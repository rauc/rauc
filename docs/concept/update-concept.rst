Robust Auto-Update Controller -- RAUC
#####################################

This document describes a generic update concept and toolchain for embedded Linux systems.

Terminology
===========

update controller
  This controls the update process and can be started on demand or run as a daemon.

update handler
  The handler performs the actual update installation.
  A default implementation is provided with the **update controller** and can
  be overridden in the **update manifest**.
  
update bundle
  The bundle is a single file containing an update. It consists of a squashfs
  with an appended cryptographic signature.
  It contains the **update manifest**, one or more images and optionally an
  **update handler**.

update manifest
  This contains information about update compatibility, image hashes and
  references the optional **handler**.
  It is either contained in a **bundle** or downloaded individually over the
  network.

slots
  Slots are possible targets for (parts of) updates. Usually they are
  partitions on a SD/eMMC, UBI volumes on NAND/NOR flash or raw block devices.
  For filesystem slots, the **controller** stores status information in a file
  in that filesystem.

slot class
  All slots with the same purpose (such as rootfs, appfs) belong to the same
  **slot class**.
  Only one slot per class can be active at runtime.

install group
  If a system consists of more than only the root file system, additional
  slots are bound to one of the root file system slots.
  They form an **install group**.
  An update can be applied only to members of the same group.

system configuration
  This configures the **controller** and contains compatibility information
  and slot definitions.
  For now, this file is shipped as part of the root filesystem.

boot chooser
  The bootloader component that determines which slot to boot from.

recovery system
  A non-updatable initial (fatory default) system, capable of running the
  update service to recover the system if all other slots are damaged.


Objectives
==========

- The update system is intended to be **flexible** and **generic**, while
  unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

- The update system *must* allow both to **update a running system** as well
  as **initializing a factory system**.

- If an update fails, a minimal (factory) **fallback system** *must* assure
  that the system can be recovered by installing an update.

- The update system *should* be able to **skip parts of an update** if the
  current version and the version contained in an update are identical.

- The update system *must* accept only **valid signed firmware**

- An update *may* consist of **multiple firmware bundles**.


Overview
========

Being able to safely update an entire system with pre-defined images
normally requires more than one bootable device or partition available.
A minimal setup would consist of a running system on slot A and an inactive
system on slot B. A bootloader is responsible for booting the desired system.

Now, the running system may perform an update on the inactive slot B.
Once the update was performed sucessfully, the system must tell the bootloader
to boot from slot B from now on.
To add more safety, a third bootable slot C may be used containing a minimal
fallback system the bootloader may choose if booting from the other slots fails.
This one might also be used to initially install a production system on a
new device.

In the following an overview of the basic concept for realizing such an
update system is provided.

Booting
-------

To determine from which slot the system is booted, the bootloader must
provide a *boot chooser*.
This allows maintaining multiple boot sources with a
*defined priority*, a *number of boot attempts*, and a flag to deactivate the source.

If booting from the highest-priority system
(typically the current production system) fails for e.g. 3 times,
the next lower priority boot source is chosen (which could be the fallback system).

As updates are always installed in a currently inactive slot,
the boot priority must be changed after a successful update.

Basic update procedure
----------------------

An *update controller* either running on the currently running system or on
a minimal fallback system handles incoming update requests.
An update request may be initiated manually from the command line or by a
script that checks for example for insertion of an USB stick containing a
*firmware bundle*.
A firmware bundle is a squashfs-packed set of config files, scripts, and disk
images with an appended signature that allows verifying the bundle's origin
and integrity.
For uploading a *bundle* to the system using a web interface, the required
web server is out of scope for the update server. The web server needs to
receive the bundle and trigger the *controller*.

Once the update controller receives an update request instruction containing
the file path of a firmware bundle it verifies its signature based on a public
key stored in the current rootfs.
If the signature is valid, the service loopback-mounts the bundle to access its
content and installs the update.

Installing the update means either calling an *update handler* included in the
bundle (if provided) or using a default handler that performs the update
based on information about the available slots and versions.


Update Controller
=================

The update controller is written in C using glib. It runs in background on the
currently active system and can be controlled using a CLI or directly via D-Bus.
The CLI provides a simple text-based interface to initiate and monitor update
requests.
This eases both manual invocation as well as writing scripts.

::

  rauc install <file>

  rauc install /mnt/sdcard0/FooCorp_SuperBarBazzer_1.2.raucb

Update Procedure
----------------

1. Verify bundle integrity (using the signature)

2. Mount squashfs

3. Verify compatibility information

   - system compatibility is defined in the *system configuration*
   - update compatibility is defined in the *update manifest*
   - if the update is incompatible, reject the update (when running the
     *fallback system*, allow overriding the compatibility by the user)

4. Check for update handler, use default if not configured

5. Select target *install group*

6. Run the *update handler*

7. Reboot (depending on update success)


Target Slot Selection
---------------------

The *boot chooser* passes the name of the booted slot using the kernel command
line. This allows the *controller* to identify the currently active slots.

To select the target slot, the controller first looks for a slot marked as
non-bootable. This could be caused by an interrupted update or repeated boot
failures.

If no non-bootable slot exists, the inactive slot with the lowest priority is
selected.


Status Feedback
---------------

A D-Bus interface provides status, errors, and progress information such as

- ``update failed``

- ``incompatible firmware``

- ``update started (0%)``

- ``rootfs updated (50%)``

- ``appfs skipped (80%)``
  
- ``update finished (100%)``

(produced by the *controller* and the *handler*, forwarded via D-Bus by controller)

A frontend (e.g. a wep page) may use this to give user information about the update status.


Update Handler
--------------

An update bundle may come with a custom update handler included which is
executed as root and has unlimited access to the system.
If none is included, a default update handler located in the currently
running system is executed.

This default update handler handles the most common cases for updating a system.

The *controller* provides the required information in environment variables:

SYSTEM_CONFIG
  filesystem path to the *system configuration* file
CURRENT_BOOTNAME
  *bootname* of the currently running system
TARGET_SLOTS
  list of the *slots* to be updated
UPDATE_SOURCE
  filesystem path to the *bundle* contents (images)
MOUNT_PREFIX
  filesystem path to be used for mounting slots

To install an update, the *handler* usually performs the following steps:

1. Load meta-data from ``$UPDATE_SOURCE/manifest.raucm``

2. Mark target slots as non-bootable for the *boot chooser*

3. For each image listed in the *manifest*:

   1. Find, check and mount destination slot (possibly creating the filesystem)

   2. Compare slot status information

   3. Skip if identical, install update otherwise

   4. Update slot status file

4. Extract updated keyring (if supplied with the update)

5. After successful update, set target slot as bootable for the *boot chooser*

6. Return to the *controller* (with update success status)


Config file descriptions
========================

System Configuration File
-------------------------

A configuration file located in ``/etc/rauc/system.conf`` describes the
number and type of available slots.
It is used to validate storage locations for update images.
Each board type requires its special configuration.

Example configuration:

::

  [system]
  compatible=FooCorp Super BarBazzer
  bootloader=barebox

  [keyring]
  path=/etc/rauc/keyring/

  [slot.rescue.0]
  device=/dev/mtd4
  type=raw
  bootname=factory0
  readonly=true

  [slot.rootfs.0]
  device=/dev/sda0
  type=ext4
  bootname=system0

  [slot.rootfs.1]
  device=/dev/sda1
  type=ext4
  bootname=system1

  [slot.appfs.0]
  device=/dev/sda2
  type=ext4
  parent=rootfs.0

  [slot.appfs.1]
  device=/dev/sda3
  type=ext4
  parent=rootfs.1


This file is (currently) part of the root file system.

The ``system``  section contains the ``compatible`` string which must describe
the board and its function as distinctly as it is required to assure that
only update bundles designed for this specific type can be installed.
The ``bootloader`` entry gives a hint which boot chooser implementation is
available.

The ``keyring`` section refers to the trusted keyring used for signature
verification.

Each slot is identified by a section starting with ``slot.`` followed by
the slot class name, and a slot number.
The *slot class* name is used in the *update manifest* to target the correct
set of slots.
``device`` points to the Linux device name for this slot.
`type`` provides a hint if and which file system the slot has.
``bootname`` is the name the bootloader uses for this slot.

A ``readonly`` slot cannot be a target slot.

The ``parent`` entry is used to bind additional slots to a bootable root
file system slot.
This is used together with the ``bootname`` to identify the currently active
slot, so that the inactive one can be selected as the update target.
The inactive root file system and all slots bound to it form the *install
group*.
An update is always applied only to slots of the *install group*.

Update Manifest
---------------

An update manifest file is located in each update as ``manifest.raucm``.
It describes update meta-data and slots to update (e.g. for the *update handler*)

Example manifest:

::

  [update]
  compatible=FooCorp Super BarBazzer
  version=2015.04-1
  
  [keyring]
  archive=release.tar

  [handler]
  filename=custom_handler.sh

  [image.rootfs]
  sha256=b14c1457dc10469418b4154fef29a90e1ffb4dddd308bf0f2456d436963ef5b3
  filename=rootfs.ext4
  
  [image.appfs]
  sha256=ecf4c031d01cb9bfa9aa5ecfce93efcf9149544bdbf91178d2c2d9d1d24076ca
  filename=appfs.ext4


The ``compatible`` string is used to determine whether the update image is
compatible with the target system.
An update is allowed only if the *update manifest* string and the system
information string match exactly.

If no handler section is present, the default handler is chosen.

If no keyring section is present, the keyring is copied from the currently
running system.

Slot name suffix of images must match the slot class name (slot.class.#).

The ``sha`` entry provides the slot images hash while the ``filename`` entry
provides the name of the slot's update image.
The filename suffix should either match the file system type (.ext4, .ubifs,
...) or be .tar* for an archive to be extracted into an empty file system.


.. TODO: Some words how multi-bundle updates might work


Slot status file
----------------

A slot status file is placed in the root of every slot containing a file system.
It describes the current version of the content in this slot.

Example:

::

  [slot]
  status=ok
  sha256=e437ab217356ee47cd338be0ffe33a3cb6dc1ce679475ea59ff8a8f7f6242b27


The version of each image of an update is identified by a hash over this image,
pre-calculated by RAUC. Currently, SHA-256 is used as hash function.
The Manifest file contains the hash for each slot.
It is compared against the hash stored in a slots status file to
determine if the version is equal.

After installation of a slot the slots hash (as provided by the upate manifest)
is used to write the new slot status file.


Signature and Verification
==========================

To sign and verify updates, a X.509 Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used. While RAUC only requires
images signed with a key which can be verified against the trusted keyring,
a PKI setup similar to the following is recommended:

::

  * "FooCorp Firmware Update CA (root)" (kept offline)
    - "FooCorp Firmware Update (development)" (kept offline)
      + "FooCorp Auto-Builder (Super BarBazzer)" (on the build server for
        automatic signing)
    - "FooCorp Firmware Update (release)" (kept offline)
      + "FooCorp Release (Super BarBazzer)" (for manual resigning of development
        *bundles* for release)

By having separate intermediate CAs for development and release, it is possible
to safely perform automatic creation and signing of *update bundles* on the build
servers. Development systems and systems in the factory are configured to trust
both the "release" and the "development" CAs. Production systems instead only
trust the "release" CA.

This way development systems can be updated using the automatically generated
updates. Also, the factory image will accept "release" updates, which allows
them to be switched to the "release" keyring as described below.


Keyring Update
--------------

Each update can optionally contain a new trusted keyring. The *handler*
installs this keyring to the updated slot. If no new keyring is provided,
the current keyring for the running system will be used instead. They keyring
consists of one or more CA certificates and the corresponding 
Certificate revocation lists (CRLs), so that certificates can be verified 
even without network access.


Image Resigning
---------------

To avoid having to rebuild a well-tested software version before releasing it
to production systems, RAUC supports resigning an existing *bundle* with a new
key. During resigning, the keyring contained in the bundle can be replaced with
a different one (for example replacing "development" with "release" trusted
keyring and signature).


Key Revocation
--------------

Using different keys for each purpose is recommended. If a key becomes
compromised, it can be revoked and the new CRL
distributed using an update bundle.

The certificate lifetimes should be configured to avoid problems due to invalid
system time (broken/missing RTC).


Generating System and Firmware Images
=====================================

A build system is used to generate all the slot images required for an update
bundle, which is then created and signed using the ``rauc bundle`` command.

Generating the Fallback System
------------------------------

The fallback system is a minimal Linux system which contains a known-good
RAUC installation. It must be installed using conventional approaches such as
manually copying disk images.

Content of the system

- minimal kernel
  
- minimal rootfs (or appended InitRAMFS)

  - minimal Linux userspace

  - *update controller*
  
  - *system configuration file*
  
  - default *update handler*

  - trusted keyring

Generating Updates
------------------

The build system generates separate filesystems images or tar archives for each
slot:

- rootfs

  - Linux kernel (in ``/boot``, optionally with InitRAMFS/DTB)

  - Linux userspace

  - *update controller*
  
  - *system configuration file*
  
  - default *updater handler*

  - trusted keyring

- appfs

  - application binaries

Then, ``rauc bundle`` can be used by the build system to create an update
bundle signed by a development key.

RAUC
====

This section shortly summarizes parts of the command-line api for RAUC.

RAUC CLI
--------

::

  rauc bundle --key=<keyfile> <input-dir> <output-file>

::

  rauc resign --key=<keyfile> <input-bundle> <output-bundle>

::

  rauc info <bundle>

::

  rauc install <file>

::

  rauc status


RAUC Command API
----------------

These commands can be used by the *handler* to reuse existing functionality in RAUC.

::

  rauc-cmd boot select <slot>

::

  rauc-cmd boot disable <slot>

::

  rauc-cmd mount <slot>

::

  rauc-cmd umount <slot>



Future Improvements
===================

Fine-Grained Handler Hooks
--------------------------

*rauc-handler prepare <device> <slot-mountpoint>*
  check, mount, (format,)

*rauc-handler install <img> <slot-mountpoint>*
  install image to mounted slot

*rauc-handler finalize <slot-mountpoint>*
  unmount, select next boot source

Network Updates
---------------

RAUC should regularly contact an update server and download images if a new
version is available.

*staged updates*
  avoid updating all systems at once

Split Updates
-------------

For cases where RAM or other resource limitations make it impossible to update
the whole system at once, it should be possible to apply an update with
serveral steps.

The manifest in the first bundle should contain enough information so that
RAUC can request the required update parts from the user.
The RAUC process stays active over the full install process and keeps track
of the update progress.

If the system is rebooted during a split update, the update is regarded as
failed and needs to be reinstalled from the beginning.
