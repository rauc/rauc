Security
--------

The RAUC bundle format consists of a squashfs image containing the images and
the manifest, which is followed by a public key signature over the full image.
This signature is stored in the CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax, see RFC5652_)
format.
Before installation, the signature is verified against the keyring(s) already
stored on the system.

.. _RFC5652: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652

We selected the CMS to avoid designing and implementing our own custom security
mechanism (which often results in vulnerabilities).
CMS is well proven in S/MIME and has widely available implementations, while
supporting simple and as well as complex PKI use-cases (certificate expiry,
intermediate CAs, revocation, algorithm selection, hardware security modules…)
without additional complexity in RAUC itself.

RAUC uses OpenSSL_ as a library for signing and verification of bundles.
A PKI with intermediate CAs for the unit tests is generated by the
``test/openssl-ca.sh`` shell script available from `GitHub
<https://github.com/rauc/rauc/blob/master/test/openssl-ca.sh>`_, which may also
be useful as an example for creating your own PKI.

.. _OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/

In the following sections, general CA configuration, some use-cases and
corresponding PKI setups are described.

CA Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenSSL uses an ``openssl.cnf`` file to define paths to use for signing, default
parameters for certificates and additional parameters to be stored during
signing.
Configuring a CA correctly (and securely) is a complex topic and obviously
exceeds the scope of this documentation.
As a starting point, the OpenSSL manual pages (especially ca_, req_, x509_, cms_,
verify_ and config_) and Stefan H. Holek's pki-tutorial_ are useful.

Single Key
~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out
cert.pem -days 365 -nodes`` to create a key and a self-signed certificate.
While you can use RAUC with these, you can't:

* replace expired certificates without updating the keyring
* distinguish between development versions and releases
* revoke a compromised key

Simple CA
~~~~~~~~~

By using the (self-signed) root CA only for signing other keys, which are used
for bundle signing, you can:

* create one key per developer, with limited validity periods
* revoke keys and ship the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) with an update

With this setup, you can reduce the impact of a compromised developer key.

Separate Development and Release CAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By creating a complete separate CA and bundle signing keys, you can give only
specific persons (or roles) the keys necessary to sign final releases.
Each device only has one of the two CAs in its keyring, allowing only
installation of the corresponding updates.

While using signing also during development may seem unnecessary, the additional
testing of the whole update system (RAUC, bootloader, migration code, …) allows
finding problems much earlier.

Intermediate Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RAUC allows you to include intermediate certificates in the bundle signature
that can be used to close the trust chain during bundle signature verification.

To do this, specify the ``--intermediate`` argument during bundle creation::

  rauc bundle --intermediate=/path/to/intermediate.ca.pem [...]

Note that you can specify the ``--intermediate`` argument multiple times to
include multiple intermediate certificates to your bundle signature.

.. _sec-resign:

Resigning Bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RAUC allows to replace the signature of a bundle.
A typical use case for this is if a bundle that was generated by an autobuilder
and signed with a development certificate was tested successfully on your target
and should now become a release bundle.
For this it needs to be resigned with the release key without modifying
the content of the bundle itself.

This is what the ``resign`` command of RAUC is for::

  rauc resign --cert=<certfile> --key=<keyfile> --keyring=<keyring> <input-bundle> <output-bundle>

It verifies the bundle against the given keyring, strips the old signature and
attaches a new one based on the key and cert files provided.

Switching the Keyring -- SPKI hashes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When switching from a development to a release signature, it is typically
required to also equip the rootfs with a different keyring file.

While the development system should accept both development and release
certificates, the release system should accept only release certificates.

One option to perform this exchange without having to build a new rootfs would
be to include both a keyring for the development case as well as a keyring for
the release case.

Doing this would be possible in a slot's post-install hook, for example.
Depending on whether the bundle to install was signed with a development or a
release certificate, either the production or development keyring will be copied
to the location where RAUC expects it to be.

To allow comparing hashes, RAUC generates SPKI hashes (i.e. hashes over the
entire public key information of a certificate) out of each signature
contained in the bundle's trust chain.
The SPKI hashes are invariant over changes in signature meta data (such as the
validity dates) while allowing to securely compare the certificate ownership.

A simple call of ``rauc info`` will list the SPKI hashes for each certificate
contained in the validated trust chain::

  Certificate Chain:
   0 Subject: /O=Test Org/CN=Test Org Release-1
     Issuer: /O=Test Org/CN=Test Org Provisioning CA Release
     SPKI sha256: 94:67:AB:31:08:04:3D:2D:62:D5:EE:58:D6:2F:86:7A:F2:77:94:29:9B:46:11:00:EC:D4:7B:1B:1D:42:8E:5A
   1 Subject: /O=Test Org/CN=Test Org Provisioning CA Release
     Issuer: /O=Test Org/CN=Test Org Provisioning CA Root
     SPKI sha256: 47:D4:9D:73:9B:11:FB:FD:AB:79:2A:07:36:B7:EF:89:3F:34:5F:D4:9B:F3:55:0F:C1:04:E7:CC:2F:32:DB:11
   2 Subject: /O=Test Org/CN=Test Org Provisioning CA Root
     Issuer: /O=Test Org/CN=Test Org Provisioning CA Root
     SPKI sha256: 00:34:F8:FE:5A:DC:3B:0D:FE:64:24:07:27:5D:14:4D:E2:39:8C:68:CC:9A:86:DD:67:03:D7:15:11:16:B4:4E

A post-install hook instead can access the SPKI hashes via the environment
variable ``RAUC_BUNDLE_SPKI_HASHES`` that will be set by RAUC when invoking the
hook script.
This variable will contain a space-separated list of the hashes in the same order
they are listed in ``rauc info``.
This list can be used to define a condition in the hook for either installing
one or the other keyring file on the target.

Example hook shell script code for above trust chain:

.. code-block:: sh

  case "$1" in

  	[...]

  	slot-post-install)

  		[...]

  		# iterate over trust chain SPKI hashes (from leaf to root)
  		for i in $RAUC_BUNDLE_SPKI_HASHES; do
  			# Test for development intermediate certificate
  			if [ "$i" == "46:9E:16:E2:DC:1E:09:F8:5B:7F:71:D5:DF:D0:A4:91:7F:FE:AD:24:7B:47:E4:37:BF:76:21:3A:38:49:89:5B" ]; then
  				echo "Activating development key chain"
  				mv /etc/rauc/devel-keyring.pem /etc/rauc/keyring.pem
  				break
  			fi
  			# Test for release intermediate certificate
  			if [ "$i" == "47:D4:9D:73:9B:11:FB:FD:AB:79:2A:07:36:B7:EF:89:3F:34:5F:D4:9B:F3:55:0F:C1:04:E7:CC:2F:32:DB:11" ]; then
  				echo "Activating release key chain"
  				mv /etc/rauc/release-keyring.pem /etc/rauc/keyring.pem
  				break
  			fi
  		done
  		;;

  	[...]

.. _pkcs11-support:

PKCS#11 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RAUC can use certificates and keys which are stored in a PKCS#11-supporting
smart-card, USB token (such as a `YubiKey <https://www.yubico.com>`_) or
Hardware Security Module (HSM).
For all commands which need create a signature ``bundle``, ``convert`` and
``resign``, `PKCS#11 URLs <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7512>`_ can be used
instead of filenames for the ``--cert`` and ``--key`` arguments.

For example, a bundle can be signed with a certificate and key available as
``pkcs11:token=rauc;object=autobuilder-1``::

  rauc bundle \
    --cert='pkcs11:token=rauc;object=autobuilder-1' \
    --key='pkcs11:token=rauc;object=autobuilder-1' \
    <input-dir> <output-file>

.. note::
  Most PKCS#11 implementations require a PIN for signing operations.
  You can either enter the PIN interactively as requested by RAUC or use the
  ``RAUC_PKCS11_PIN`` environment variable to specify the PIN to use.

When working with PKCS#11, some tools are useful to configure and show your tokens:

`p11-kit <https://github.com/p11-glue/p11-kit>`_
  p11-kit is an abstraction layer which provides access to multiple PKCS#11 modules.

  It contains ``p11tool``, which is useful to see available tokens and objects
  (keys and certificates) and their URLs::

    $ p11tool --list-tokens
    …
    Token 5:
	    URL: pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=9f03d1aaed92ef58;token=rauc
	    Label: rauc
	    Type: Generic token
	    Manufacturer: SoftHSM project
	    Model: SoftHSM v2
	    Serial: 9f03d1aaed92ef58
	    Module: /usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so
    $ p11tool --login --list-all pkcs11:token=rauc
    Token 'rauc' with URL 'pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=9f03d1aaed92ef58;token=rauc' requires user PIN
    Enter PIN: ****
    Object 0:
	    URL: pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=9f03d1aaed92ef58;token=rauc;id=%01;object=autobuilder-1;type=public
	    Type: Public key
	    Label: autobuilder-1
	    Flags: CKA_WRAP/UNWRAP;
	    ID: 01

    Object 1:
	    URL: pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=9f03d1aaed92ef58;token=rauc;id=%01;object=autobuilder-1;type=private
	    Type: Private key
	    Label: autobuilder-1
	    Flags: CKA_WRAP/UNWRAP; CKA_PRIVATE; CKA_SENSITIVE;
	    ID: 01

    Object 2:
	    URL: pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=9f03d1aaed92ef58;token=rauc;id=%01;object=autobuilder-1;type=cert

	    ID: 01


`OpenSC <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC>`_
  OpenSC is the standard open source framework for smart card access.

  It provides ``pkcs11-tool``, which is useful to prepare a token for usage
  with RAUC.
  It can list, read/write objects, generate keypairs and more.

`libp11 <https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11>`_
  libp11 is an engine plugin for OpenSSL, which allows using keys on PKCS#11
  tokens with OpenSSL.

  It will automatically use p11-kit (if available) to access all configured
  PKCS#11 modules.

  .. note::
    If you cannot use p11-kit, you can also use the ``RAUC_PKCS11_MODULE``
    environment variable to select the PKCS#11 module.

`SoftHSM2 <https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2>`_
  SoftHSM2 is software implementation of a HSM with a PKCS#11 interface.

  It is used in the RAUC test suite to emulate a real HSM and can also be used
  to try the PKCS#11 functionality in RAUC without any hardware.
  The ``prepare_softhsm2`` shell function in ``test/rauc.t`` can be used as an
  example on how to initialize SoftHSM2 token.

Data Storage and Migration
--------------------------

Most systems require a location for storing configuration data such as
passwords, ssh keys or application data.
When performing an update, you have to ensure that the updated system takes
over or can access the data of the old system.

Storing Data in The Root File System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of a writable root file system, it often contains additional data,
for example cryptographic material specific to the machine, or configuration
files modified by the user.
When performing the update, you have to ensure that the files you need to
preserve are copied to the target slot after having written
the system data to it.

RAUC provides support for executing *hooks* from different slot installation
stages.
For migrating data from your old rootfs to your updated rootfs,
simply specify a slot post-install hook.
Read the :ref:`Hooks <sec-hooks>` chapter on how to create one.

Using Data Partitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, there are a couple of reasons why you don't want to or cannot store
your data inside the root file system:

* You want to keep your rootfs read-only to reduce probability of corrupting it.
* You have a non-writable rootfs such as SquashFS.
* You want to keep your data separated from the rootfs to ease setup, reset or
  recovery.

In this case you need a separate storage location for your data on a different
partition, volume or device.

If the update concept uses full redundant root file systems,
there are also good reasons for using a redundant data storage, too.
Read below about the possible impact on data migration.

To let your system access the separate storage location, it has to be mounted
into your rootfs.
Note that if you intend to store configurable system information on your data
partition, you have to map the default Linux paths (such as ``/etc/passwd``) to
your data storage. You can do this by using:

 * symbolic links
 * bind mounts
 * an overlay file system

It depends on the amount and type of data you want to handle which option you
should choose.

Application Data Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/data_migration.svg
  :width: 500

Both a single and a redundant data storage have their advantages and
disadvantages.
Note when storing data inside your rootfs you will have a redundant setup by
design and cannot choose.


The decision about how to set up a configuration storage and how to handle it
depends on several aspects:

* May configuration formats change over different application versions?
* Can a new application read (and convert) old data?
* Does your infrastructure allow working on possibly obsolete data?
* Enough storage to store data redundantly?
* ...

The basic advantages and disadvantages a single or a redundant setup implicate
are listed below:

+-----------+--------------------------+---------------------------+
|           | Single Data              | Redundant Data            |
+===========+==========================+===========================+
| Setup     | easy                     | assure using correct one  |
+-----------+--------------------------+---------------------------+
| Migration | no backup by default     | copy on update, migrate   |
+-----------+--------------------------+---------------------------+
| Fallback  | tricky (reconvert data?) | easy (old data!)          |
+-----------+--------------------------+---------------------------+

.. _casync-support:

RAUC casync Support
-------------------

.. warning:: casync support is still experimental and lacks some unit tests.

  When evaluating, make sure to compile a recent casync version from the
  `git <https://github.com/systemd/casync>`_ for testing.

Using the Content-Addressable Data Synchronization tool `casync` for updating
embedded / IoT devices provides a couple of benefits.
By splitting and chunking the update artifacts into reusable pieces, casync
allows to

 * stream remote bundles to the target without occupying storage / NAND
 * minimize transferred data for an update by downloading only the delta to the
   running system
 * reduce data storage on server side by eliminating redundancy
 * good handling for CDNs due to similar chunk sizes

For a full description of the way casync works and what you can do with it,
refer to the
`blog post <http://0pointer.net/blog/casync-a-tool-for-distributing-file-system-images.html>`_
by its author Lennart Poettering or visit the
`GitHub site <https://github.com/systemd/casync>`_.

RAUC supports using casync index files instead of complete images in its bundles.
This way the real size of the bundle comes down to the size of the index files
required for referring to the individual chunks.
The real image data contained in the individual chunks can be stored in one
single repository, for a whole systems with multiple images as well as for
multiple systems in different versions, etc.
This makes the approach quite flexible.

Creating casync Bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating RAUC bundles with casync index files is a bit different from creating
'conventional' bundles.
While the bundle format remains the same and you could also mix conventional
and casync-based bundles, creating these bundles is not straight forward when
using common embedded build systems such as Yocto, PTXdist or buildroot.

Because of this, we decided use a two-step process for creating casync RAUC
bundles:

 1. Create 'conventional' RAUC bundle
 2. Convert to casync-based RAUC bundle

RAUC provides a command for creating casync-based bundles from  'conventional'
bundles.
Simply call::

  rauc convert --cert=<certfile> --key=<keyfile> --keyring=<keyring> conventional-bundle.raucb casync-bundle.raucb

The conversion process will create two new artifacts:

 1. The converted bundle `casync-bundle.raucb` with casnyc index files instead
    of image files
 2. A casync chunk store `casync-bundle.castr/` for all bundle images.
    This is a directory with chunks grouped by subfolders of the first 4 digits
    of their chunk ID.

Installing casync Bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main difference between installing conventional bundles and bundles that
contain casync index files is that RAUC requires access to the remote casync
chunk store during installation of the bundle.

Due to the built-in network support of both casync and RAUC, it is possible to
directly give a network URL as the source of the bundle::

  rauc install https://server.example.com/deploy/bundle-20180112.raucb

By default, RAUC will assume the corresponding casync chunk store is located at
the same location as the bundle (with the ``.castr`` extension instead of
``.raucb``), in this example at
``https://server.example.com/deploy/bundle-20180112.castr``.
The default location can also be configured in the system config to point to a
generic location that is valid for all installations.

When installing a bundle, the casync implementation will automatically handle
the chunk download via an unprivileged helper binary.

Reducing Download Size -- Seeding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reducing the amount of data to be transferred over slow connections is one of
the main goals of using casync for updating.
Casync splits up the images or directory trees it handles into reusable chunks
of similar size.
Doing this both on the source as well as on the destination side allows
comparing the hashes of the resulting chunks to know which parts are different.

When we update a system, we usually do not change its entire file tree, but
only update a few libraries, the kernel, the application, etc.
Thus, most of the data can be retrieved from the currently active system and
does not need to be fetched via the network.

For each casync image that RAUC extracts to the target slot, it determines an
appropriate seed.
This is normally a redundant slot of the same class as the target slot but from
the currently booted slot group.

.. note::
  Depending on your targets processing and storage speed, updating slots with
  casync can be a bit slower than conventional updates,
  because casync first has to process the entire seed slot to calculate the
  seed chunks.
  After this is done it will start writing the data and fetch missing chunks
  via the network.

.. _sec-variants:

Handling Board Variants With a Single Bundle
--------------------------------------------

If you have hardware variants that require installing different images
(e.g. for the kernel or for an FPGA bitstream), but have other slots
that are common (such as the rootfs) between all hardware variants,
RAUC allows you to put multiple different variants of these images in the
same bundle.
RAUC calls this feature 'image variants'.

.. image:: images/rauc-image-variants.svg
  :width: 300

If you want to make use of image variants, you first of all need to say which
variant your specific board is. You can do this in your ``system.conf`` by
setting exactly one of the keys ``variant-dtb``, ``variant-file`` or
``variant-name``.

.. code-block:: cfg

  [system]
  ...
  variant-dtb=true

The ``variant-dtb`` is a boolean that allows (on device-tree based boards)
to use the systems compatible string as the board variant.

.. code-block:: cfg

  [system]
  ...
  variant-file=/path/to/file

A more generic alternative is the ``variant-file`` key.
It allows to specify a file that will be read to obtain the variant name.
Note that the content of the file should be a simple string without any line
breaks.
A typical use case would be to generate this file (in ``/run``) during system
startup from a value you obtained from your bootloader.
Another use case is to have a RAUC post-install hook that copies this file from
the old system to the newly updated one.

.. code-block:: cfg

  [system]
  ...
  variant-name=myvariant-name

A third variant to specify the systems variant is to give it directly in your
system.conf.
This method is primary meant for testing, as this prevents having a generic
rootfs image for all variants!


In your manifest, you can specify variants of an image (e.g. the kernel here) as
follows:

.. code-block:: cfg

  [image.kernel.variant-1]
  filename=variant1.img
  ...

  [image.kernel.variant-2]
  filename=variant1.img
  ...

It is allowed to have both a specific variant as well as a default image in the
same bundle.
If a specific variant of the image is available, it will be used on that system.
On all other systems, the default image will be used instead.

If you have a specific image variant for one of your systems,
it is mandatory to also have a default or specific variant for the same slot
class for any other system you intend to update.
RAUC will report an error if for example a bootloader image is only present for
variant A when you try to install on variant B.
This should prevent from bricking your device by unintentional partial updates.

.. _sec-manual-write:

Manually Writing Images to Slots
--------------------------------

In order to write an image to a slot without using update mechanics like hooks,
slot status etc. use:

.. code-block:: sh

  rauc write-slot <slotname> <image>

This uses the correct handler to write the image to the slot. It is useful for
development scenarios as well as initial provisioning of embedded boards.

Updating the Bootloader
-----------------------

Updating the bootloader is a special case, as it is a single point of failure on
most systems:
The selection of which redundant system images should be booted cannot
itself be implemented in a redundant component (otherwise there would need to
be an even earlier selection component).

Some SoCs contain a fixed firmware or ROM code which already supports redundant
bootloaders, possibly integrated with a HW watchdog or boot counter.
On these platforms, it is possible to have the selection point before the
bootloader, allowing it to be stored redundantly and updated as any other
component.

If redundant bootloaders with fallback is not possible (or too inflexible) on
your platform, you may instead be able to ensure that the bootloader update is
atomic.
This doesn't support recovering from a buggy bootloader, but will prevent a
non-bootable system caused by an error or power-loss during the update.

Whether atomic bootloader updates can be implemented depends on your
SoC/firmware and storage medium.

.. _sec-emmc-boot:

Update eMMC Boot Partitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RAUC supports updating eMMC boot partitions (see the JEDEC standard JESD84-B51_
for details), one of which gets enabled atomically via configuration registers
in the eMMC (*ext_csd registers*).

.. _JESD84-B51: http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/results/jesd84-b51

The required slot type is ``boot-emmc``.
The device to be specified is expected to be the root device.
The boot partitions are derived automatically.
A ``system.conf`` could look like this:

.. code-block:: cfg

  [slot.bootloader.0]
  device=/dev/mmcblk1
  type=boot-emmc

.. important::

  A kernel bug may prevent consistent toggling of the eMMC ext_csd boot
  partition register.
  Be sure your kernel is >= 4.16-rc7 (resp. >= 4.15.14, >= 4.14.31) or contains
  this patch: https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg48271.html

Bootloader Update Ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NXP i.MX6 supports up to four bootloader copies when booting from NAND
flash.
The ROM code will try each copy in turn until it finds one which is readable
without uncorrectable ECC errors and has a correct header.
By using the trait of NAND flash that interrupted writes cause ECC errors and
writing the first page (containing the header) last, the bootloader images can
be replaced one after the other, while ensuring that the system will boot even in
case of a crash or power failure.

The slot type could be called "boot-imx6-nand" analogous to eMMC.

Considerations When Updating the Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Booting an old system with a new bootloader is usually not tested during
development, increasing the risk of problems appearing only in the field.
If you want to address this issue do not add the bootloader to your bundle, but
rather use an approach like this:

* Store a copy of the bootloader in the rootfs.
* Use RAUC only to update the rootfs. The combinations to test
  can be reduced by limiting which old versions are supported by an update.
* Reboot into the new system.
* On boot, before starting the application, check that the current slot
  is 'sane'. Then check if the installed bootloader is older than the
  version shipped in the (new) rootfs. In that case:

  * Disable the old rootfs slot and update the bootloader.
  * Reboot
* Start the application.

This way you still have fallback support for the rootfs upgrade and need
to test only:

* The sanity check functionality and the bootloader installation when started
  from old bootloader and new rootfs
* Normal operation when started from new bootloader and new rootfs

The case of new bootloader with old rootfs can never happen, because you
disable the old one from the new before installing a new bootloader.

If you need to ensure that you can fall back to the secondary slot even after
performing the bootloader update, you should check that the "other" slot
contains the same bootloader version as the currently running one during the
sanity check.
This means that you need to update both slots in turn before the bootloader is
updated.

Updating Sub-Devices
--------------------

Besides the internal storage, some systems have external components or
sub-devices which can be updated.
For example:

* Firmware for micro-controllers on modular boards
* Firmware for a system management controller
* FPGA bitstreams (stored in a separate flash)
* Other Linux-based systems in the same enclosure
* Software for third-party hardware components

In many cases, these components have some custom interface to query the
currently installed version and to upload an update.
They may or may not have internal redundancy or recovery mechanisms as well.

Although it is possible to configure RAUC slots for these and let it call a
script to perform the installation, there are some disadvantages to this
approach:

* After a fallback to an older version in an A/B scenario, the sub-devices may be
  running an incompatible (newer) version.
* A modular sub-device may be replaced and still has an old firmware version
  installed.
* The number of sub-devices may not be fixed, so each device would need a
  different slot configuration.

Instead, a more robust approach is to store the sub-device firmware in the
rootfs and (if needed) update them to the current versions during boot.
This ensures that the sub-devices are always running the correct set of versions
corresponding to the version of the main application.

If the bootloader falls back to the previous version on the main system, the
same mechanism will downgrade the sub-devices as needed.
During a downgrade, sub-devices which are running Linux with RAUC in an A/B
scenario will detect that the image to be installed already matches the one in
the other slot and avoid unnecessary installations.

Migrating to an Updated Bundle Version
--------------------------------------

As RAUC undergoes constant development, it might be extended and new
features or enhancements will make their way into RAUC.
Thus, also the sections and options contained in the bundle manifest may be
extended over time.

To assure a well-defined and controlled update procedure,
RAUC is rather strict in parsing the manifest and will reject bundles
containing unknown configuration options.

But, this does not prevent you from being able to use those new RAUC features
on your current system.
All you have to do is to perform an *intermediate update*:

* Create a bundle containing a rootfs with the recent RAUC version,
  but *not* containing the new RAUC features in its manifest.
* Update your system and reboot
* Now you have a system with a recent RAUC version which is able to
  interpret and appropriately handle a bundle with the latest options

Software Deployment
-------------------

When designing your update infrastructure, you must think about how to deploy
the updates to your device(s).
In general, you have two major options:
Deployment via storage media such as USB sticks or network-based deployment.

As RAUC uses signed bundles instead of e.g. trusted connections to enable update
author verification, RAUC fully supports both methods with the same technique
and you may also use both of them in parallel.

Some influential factors on the method to used can be:

* Do you have network access on the device?
* How many devices have to be updated?
* Who will perform the update?

Deployment via Storage Media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method is mainly used for decentralized updates of devices without network
access (either due to missing infrastructure or because of security concerns).

To handle deployment via storage media, you need a component that detects the
plugged-in storage media and calls RAUC to trigger the actual installation.

When using systemd, you could use automount_ units for detecting plugged-in
media and trigger an installation.

Deployment via Deployment Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployment over a network is especially useful when having a larger set of
devices to update or direct access to these devices is tricky.

As RAUC focuses on update handling on the target side, it does not provide a
deployment server out of the box.
But if you do not already have a deployment infrastructure, there a few Open
Source deployment server implementations available in the wilderness.

One of it worth being mentioned is
`hawkBit <https://eclipse.org/hawkbit/>`_ from the Eclipse IoT project, which
also provides some strategies for rollout management for larger-scale device
farms.

The RAUC hawkBit client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a separate project, the RAUC development team provides a Python-based
example application that acts as a hawkBit client via its REST DDI-API while
controlling RAUC via D-Bus.

For more information and testing it, visit it on GitHub:
