System Configuration File
-------------------------

A configuration file located in ``/etc/rauc/system.conf`` describes the
number and type of available slots.
It is used to validate storage locations for update images.
Each board type requires its special configuration.

This file is part of the root file system.

.. note:: When changing the configuration file on your running target you need
  to restart the RAUC service in order to let the changes take effect.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: cfg

  [system]
  compatible=FooCorp Super BarBazzer
  bootloader=barebox
  statusfile=/data/central-status.raucs

  [keyring]
  path=/etc/rauc/keyring.pem

  [handlers]
  system-info=/usr/lib/rauc/info-provider.sh
  post-install=/usr/lib/rauc/postinst.sh

  [slot.rootfs.0]
  device=/dev/sda0
  type=ext4
  bootname=system0

  [slot.rootfs.1]
  device=/dev/sda1
  type=ext4
  bootname=system1

.. _system-section:

**[system] section**

``compatible``
  A user-defined compatible string that describes the target hardware as
  specific enough as required to prevent faulty updating systems with the wrong
  firmware. It will be matched against the ``compatible`` string defined in the
  update manifest.

``bootloader``
  The bootloader implementation RAUC should use for its slot switching
  mechanism. Currently supported values (and bootloaders) are ``barebox``,
  ``grub``, ``uboot``.

``mountprefix``
  Prefix of the path where bundles and slots will be mounted. Can be overwritten
  by the command line option ``--mount``. Defaults to ``/mnt/rauc/``.

``grubenv``
  Only valid when ``bootloader`` is set to ``grub``.
  Specifies the path under which the GRUB environment can be accessed.

``barebox-statename``
  Only valid when ``bootloader`` is set to ``barebox``.
  Overwrites the default state ``state`` to a user-defined state name. If this
  key not exists, the bootchooser framework searches per default for ``/state``
  or ``/aliases/state``.

``efi-use-bootnext``
  Only valid when ``bootloader`` is set to ``efi``.
  If set to ``false``, this disables using efi variable ``BootNext`` for
  marking a slot primary.
  This is useful for setups where the BIOS already handles the slot switching
  on watchdog resets.
  Behavior defaults to ``true`` if option is not set.

.. _activate-installed:

``activate-installed``
  This boolean value controls if a freshly installed slot is automatically
  marked active with respect to the used bootloader. Its default value is
  ``true`` which means that this slot is going to be started the next time the
  system boots. If the value of this parameter is ``false`` the slot has to be
  activated manually in order to be booted, see section :ref:`mark-active`.

.. _statusfile:

``statusfile``
  This key should be set to point to a central file where slot status
  information should be stored (e.g. slot-specific metadata, see
  :ref:`slot-status`).
  This file must be located on a non-redundant filesystem which is not
  overwritten during updates.
  In most cases, a central status file is preferable to per-slot status files
  as it allows to store data also for read-only or (temporary) filesystem-less
  slots.
  However, if a per-slot status is required as one of the above-noted
  requirements cannot be met, one can use the value ``per-slot`` to document
  this decision.
  For background compatibility this option is not mandatory and will default to
  per-slot status files if not set.

``max-bundle-download-size``
  Defines the maximum downloadable bundle size in bytes, and thus must be
  a simple integer value (without unit) greater than zero.
  It overwrites the compiled-in default value of 8 MiB.

``variant-name``
  String to be used as variant name for this board.
  If set, neither ``variant-file`` nor ``variant-dtb`` must be set.
  Refer chapter :ref:`sec-variants` for more information.

``variant-file``
  File containing variant name for this board.
  If set, neither ``variant-name`` nor ``variant-dtb`` must be set.
  Refer chapter :ref:`sec-variants` for more information.

``variant-dtb``
  If set to ``true``, use current device tree compatible as this boards variant
  name.
  If set, neither ``variant-name`` nor ``variant-file`` must be set.
  Refer chapter :ref:`sec-variants` for more information.

.. _keyring-section:

**[keyring] section**

The ``keyring`` section refers to the trusted keyring used for signature
verification.
Both ``path`` and ``directory`` options can be used together if
desired, though only one or the other is necessary to verify the bundle
signature.

``path``
  Path to the keyring file in PEM format. Either absolute or relative to the
  system.conf file.

``directory``
  Path to the keyring directory containing one or more certificates.
  Each file in this directory must contain exactly one certificate in CRL or
  PEM format.
  The filename of each certificate must have the form hash.N for a certificate
  or hash.rN for CRLs;
  where hash is obtained by ``X509_NAME_hash(3)`` or the ``--hash`` option of
  ``openssl(1)`` ``x509`` or ``crl`` commands.
  See documentation in ``X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir(3)`` for details.

``use-bundle-signing-time=<true/false>``
  If this boolean value is set to ``true`` then the bundle signing time
  is used instead of the current system time for certificate validation.

``check-crl=<true/false>``
  If this boolean value is set to ``true``, RAUC will enable checking of CRLs
  (Certificate Revocation Lists) stored in the keyring together with the CA
  certificates.
  Note that CRLs have an expiration time in their signature, so you need to
  make sure you don't end up with an expired CRL on your device (which would
  block further updates).

.. _check-purpose:

``check-purpose``
  This option can be used to set the OpenSSL certificate purpose used during
  chain verification.
  Certificates in the chain with incompatible purposes are rejected.
  Possible values are provided by OpenSSL (``any``, ``sslclient``,
  ``sslserver``, ``nssslserver``, ``smimesign``, ``smimeencrypt``) and RAUC
  (``codesign``).
  See ``-purpose`` and ``VERIFY OPERATION`` in the OpenSSL verify_ manual page
  and the :ref:`sec-key-usage` section for more information.

.. _verify: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/verify.html

**[casync] section**

The ``casync`` section contains casync-related settings.
For more information about using casync support of RAUC, refer to
:ref:`casync-support`.

``storepath``
  Allows to set the path to use as chunk store path for casync to a fixed one.
  This is useful if your chunk store is on a dedicated server and will be the
  same pool for each update you perform.
  By default, the chunk store path is derived from the location of the RAUC
  bundle you install.

``tmppath``
  Allows to set the path to use as temporary directory for casync.
  The temporary directory used by casync can be specified using the TMPDIR
  environment variable. It falls back to /var/tmp if unset.
  If ``tmppath`` is set then RAUC runs casync with TMPDIR sets to that path.
  By default, the temporary directory is left unset by RAUC and casync uses its
  internal default value ``/var/tmp``.

**[autoinstall] section**

The auto-install feature allows to configure a path that will be checked upon
RAUC service startup.
If there is a bundle placed under this specific path, this bundle will be
installed automatically without any further interaction.

This feature is useful for automatically updating the slot RAUC currently runs
from, like for asymmetric redundancy setups where the update is always
performed from a dedicated (recovery) slot.

``path``
  The full path of the bundle file to check for.
  If file at ``path`` exists, auto-install will be triggered.

**[handlers] section**

Handlers allow to customize RAUC by placing scripts in the system that RAUC can
call for different purposes. All parameters expect pathnames to the script to
be executed. Pathnames are either absolute or relative to the system.conf file
location.

RAUC passes a set of environment variables to handler scripts.
See details about using handlers in `Custom Handlers (Interface)`_.

``system-info``
  This handler will be called when RAUC starts up, right after loading the
  system configuration file.
  It is used for obtaining further information about the individual system RAUC
  runs on.
  The handler script must print the information to standard output in form of
  key value pairs ``KEY=value``.
  The following variables are supported:

  ``RAUC_SYSTEM_SERIAL``
    Serial number of the individual board

``pre-install``
  This handler will be called right before RAUC starts with the installation.
  This is after RAUC has verified and mounted the bundle, thus you can access
  bundle content.

``post-install``
  This handler will be called after a successful installation.
  The bundle is still mounted at this moment, thus you could access data in it
  if required.

``bootloader-custom-backend``
  This handler will be called to trigger the following actions:

  * get the primary slot
  * set the primary slot
  * get the boot state
  * set the boot state

  if a custom bootloader backend is used.
  See :ref:`sec-custom-bootloader-backend` for more details.

.. note::
  When using a full custom installation
  (see :ref:`[handler] section <sec-manifest-handler>`)
  RAUC will not execute any system handler script.

.. _slot.slot-class.idx-section:

**[slot.<slot-class>.<idx>] section**

Each slot is identified by a section starting with ``slot.`` followed by
the slot class name, and a slot number.
The `<slot-class>` name is used in the *update manifest* to target the correct
set of slots. It must not contain any `.` (dots) as these are used as
hierarchical separator.

``device=</path/to/dev>``
  The slot's device path. This one is mandatory.

``type=<type>``
  The type describing the slot. Currently supported ``<type>`` values are ``raw``,
  ``nand``, ``ubivol``, ``ubifs``, ``ext4``, ``vfat``.
  See table :ref:`sec-slot-type` for a more detailed list of these different types.
  Defaults to ``raw`` if none given.

``bootname=<name>``
  Registers the slot for being handled by the
  :ref:`bootselection interface <bootloader-interaction>` with the ``<name>``
  specified.
  The value must be unique across all slots.
  Only slots without a ``parent`` entry can have a ``bootname``.
  The actual meaning of the name provided depends on the bootloader
  implementation used.

``parent=<slot>``
  The ``parent`` entry is used to bind additional slots to a bootable root
  file system ``<slot>``.
  Indirect parent references are discouraged, but supported for now.
  This is used together with the ``bootname`` to identify the set of currently
  active slots, so that the inactive one can be selected as the update target.
  The parent slot is referenced using the form ``<slot-class>.<idx>``.

``allow-mounted=<true/false>``
  Setting this entry ``true`` tells RAUC that the slot may be updated even if
  it is already mounted.
  Such a slot can be updated only by a custom install hook.

``readonly=<true/false>``
  Marks the slot as existing but not updatable. May be used for sanity checking
  or informative purpose. A ``readonly`` slot cannot be a target slot.

.. _install-same:

``install-same=<true/false>``
  If set to ``false``, this will tell RAUC to skip writing slots that already
  have the same content as the one that should be installed.
  Having the 'same' content means that the hash value stored for the target
  slot and the hash value of the update image are equal.
  The default value is ``true`` here, meaning that no optimization will be done
  as this can be unexpected if RAUC is not the only one that potentially alters
  a slot's content.

  This replaces the deprecated entries ``ignore-checksum`` and
  ``force-install-same``.

``resize=<true/false>``
  If set to ``true`` this will tell RAUC to resize the filesystem after having
  written the image to this slot. This only has an effect when writing an ext4
  file system to an ext4 slot, i.e. if the slot has``type=ext4`` set.

``extra-mount-opts=<options>``
  Allows to specify custom mount options that will be passed to the slots
  ``mount`` call as ``-o`` argument value.

.. _sec_ref_manifest:

Manifest
--------

The manifest file located in a RAUC bundle describes the images packed in the
bundle and their corresponding target slot class.

A valid RAUC manifest file must be named ``manifest.raucm``.

.. code-block:: cfg

  [update]
  compatible=FooCorp Super BarBazzer
  version=2016.08-1

  [image.rootfs]
  filename=rootfs.ext4
  size=419430400
  sha256=b14c1457dc10469418b4154fef29a90e1ffb4dddd308bf0f2456d436963ef5b3

  [image.appfs]
  filename=appfs.ext4
  size=219430400
  sha256=ecf4c031d01cb9bfa9aa5ecfce93efcf9149544bdbf91178d2c2d9d1d24076ca


.. _sec-manifest-update:

**[update] section**

``compatible``
  A user-defined compatible string that must match the compatible string of the
  system the bundle should be installed on.

``version``
  A free version field that can be used to provide and track version
  information. No checks will be performed on this version by RAUC itself,
  although a handler can use this information to reject updates.

``description``
  A free-form description field that can be used to provide human-readable
  bundle information.

``build``
  A build id that would typically hold the build date or some build
  information provided by the bundle creation environment. This can help to
  determine the date and origin of the built bundle.


**[hooks] section**

``filename``
  Hook script path name, relative to the bundle content.

``hooks``
  List of hooks enabled for this bundle.
  See :ref:`sec-install-hooks` for more details.

  Valid items are: ``install-check``

.. _sec-manifest-handler:

**[handler] section**

``filename``
  Handler script path name, relative to the bundle content. Used to fully
  replace default update process.

``args``
  Arguments to pass to the handler script, such as ``args=--verbose``


.. _image.slot-class-section:

**[image.<slot-class>] section**

.. _image.slot-filename:

``filename``
  Name of the image file (relative to bundle content).
  RAUC uses the file extension and the slot type to decide how to extract the
  image file content to the slot.

``sha256``
  sha256 of image file. RAUC determines this value automatically when creating
  a bundle, thus it is not required to set this by hand.

``size``
  size of image file. RAUC determines this value automatically when creating a
  bundle, thus it is not required to set this by hand.

``hooks``
  List of per-slot hooks enabled for this image.
  See :ref:`sec-slot-hooks` for more details.

  Valid items are: ``pre-install``, ``install``, ``post-install``

.. _slot-status:

Slot Status
-----------

There is some slot specific metadata that are of interest for RAUC, e.g. a hash
value of the slot's content (SHA-256 per default) that is matched against its
counterpart of an image inside a bundle to decide if an update of the slot has
to be performed or can be skipped.
These slot metadata can be persisted in one of two ways:
either in a slot status file stored on each slot containing a writable
filesystem or in a central status file that lives on a persistent filesystem
untouched by updates.
The former is RAUC's default whereas the latter mechanism is enabled by making
use of the optional key :ref:`statusfile <statusfile>` in the ``system.conf``
file.
Both are formatted as INI-like key/value files where the slot information is
grouped in a section named [slot] for the case of a per-slot file or in sections
termed with the slot name (e.g. [slot.rootfs.1]) for the central status file:

.. code-block:: cfg

  [slot]
  bundle.compatible=FooCorp Super BarBazzer
  bundle.version=2016.08-1
  bundle.description=Introduction of Galactic Feature XYZ
  bundle.build=2016.08.1/imx6/20170324-7
  status=ok
  sha256=b14c1457dc10469418b4154fef29a90e1ffb4dddd308bf0f2456d436963ef5b3
  size=419430400
  installed.timestamp=2017-03-27T09:51:13Z
  installed.count=3

For a description of ``sha256`` and ``size`` keys see :ref:`this
<image.slot-class-section>` part of the section :ref:`Manifest
<sec_ref_manifest>`.
Having the slot's content's size allows to re-calculate the hash via ``head -c
<size> <slot-device> | sha256sum`` or ``dd bs=<size> count=1 if=<slot-device> |
sha256sum``.

The properties ``bundle.compatible``, ``bundle.version``, ``bundle.description``
and ``bundle.build`` are copies of the respective manifest properties.
More information can be found in this :ref:`subsection <sec-manifest-update>` of
section :ref:`Manifest <sec_ref_manifest>`.

RAUC also stores the point in time of installing the image to the slot in
``installed.timestamp`` as well as the number of updates so far in
``installed.count``.
Additionally RAUC tracks the point in time when a bootable slot is activated in
``activated.timestamp`` and the number of activations in ``activated.count``,
see section :ref:`mark-active`.
Comparing both timestamps is useful to decide if an installed slot has ever been
activated or if its activation is still pending.

.. _sec-handler-interface:

Custom Handlers (Interface)
---------------------------

Interaction between RAUC and custom handler shell scripts is done using shell
variables.

.. glossary::

  ``RAUC_SYSTEM_CONFIG``
    Path to the system configuration file (default path is ``/etc/rauc/system.conf``)

  ``RAUC_CURRENT_BOOTNAME``

    respective slot number).

  ``RAUC_TARGET_SLOTS``
    An iterator list similar to ``RAUC_SLOTS`` but only containing slots that
    were selected as target slots by the RAUC target slot selection algorithm.
    You may use this list for safely installing images into these slots.

  ``RAUC_SLOT_NAME_<N>``
    The name of slot number <N>, e.g. ``rootfs.0``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_CLASS_<N>``
    The class of slot number <N>, e.g. ``rootfs``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_TYPE_<N>``
    The type of slot number <N>, e.g. ``raw``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_DEVICE_<N>``
    The device path of slot number <N>, e.g. ``/dev/sda1``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_BOOTNAME_<N>``
    The bootloader name of slot number <N>, e.g. ``system0``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_PARENT_<N>``
    The name of slot number <N>, empty if none, otherwise name of parent slot


.. code::

  for i in $RAUC_TARGET_SLOTS; do
          eval RAUC_SLOT_DEVICE=\$RAUC_SLOT_DEVICE_${i}
          eval RAUC_IMAGE_NAME=\$RAUC_IMAGE_NAME_${i}
          eval RAUC_IMAGE_DIGEST=\$RAUC_IMAGE_DIGEST_${i}
  done

Hooks (Interface)
-----------------

.. _sec-install-hook-interface:

Install Hooks Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following environment variables will be passed to the hook executable:

.. glossary::

  ``RAUC_SYSTEM_COMPATIBLE``
    The compatible value set in the system configuration file,
    e.g. ``"My First Product"``

  ``RAUC_SYSTEM_VARIANT``
    The system's variant as obtained by the variant source
    (refer ref:`sec-variants`)

  ``RAUC_MF_COMPATIBLE``
    The compatible value provided by the current bundle,
    e.g. ``"My Other Product"``

  ``RAUC_MF_VERSION``
    The value of the version field as provided by the current bundle,
    e.g. ``"V1.2.1-2020-02-28"``

  ``RAUC_MOUNT_PREFIX``
    The global RAUC mount prefix path, e.g. ``"/run/mount/rauc"``

.. _sec-slot-hook-interface:

Slot Hooks Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following environment variables will be passed to the hook executable:

.. glossary::

  ``RAUC_SYSTEM_COMPATIBLE``
    The compatible value set in the system configuration file,
    e.g. ``"My Special Product"``

  ``RAUC_SYSTEM_VARIANT``
    The system's variant as obtained by the variant source
    (refer ref:`sec-variants`)

  ``RAUC_SLOT_NAME``
    The name of the currently installed slot, e.g ``"rootfs.1"``.

  ``RAUC_SLOT_STATE``
    The state of the currently installed slot
    (will always be ``inactive`` for slots we install to)

  ``RAUC_SLOT_CLASS``
    The class of the currently installed slot, e.g. ``"rootfs"``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_TYPE``
    The type of the currently installed slot, e.g. ``"ext4"``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_DEVICE``
    The device path of the currently installed slot, e.g. ``"/dev/mmcblk0p2"``

    This equals the ``device=`` parameter set in the current slot's system.conf
    entry and represents the target device RAUC installs the update to.
    For an ``install`` hook, this is the device the hook executable should write
    to.

  ``RAUC_SLOT_BOOTNAME``
    For slots with a bootname (those that can be selected by the bootloader),
    the bootname of the currently installed slot, e.g. ``"system1"``
    For slots with a parent, the parent's bootname is used.
    Note that in many cases, it's better to use the explicit ``RAUC_SLOT_NAME``
    to select different behaviour in the hook, than to rely indirectly on the
    bootname.

  ``RAUC_SLOT_PARENT``
    If set, the parent of the currently installed slot, e.g. ``"rootfs.1"``

  ``RAUC_SLOT_MOUNT_POINT``
    If available, the mount point of the currently installed slot,
    e.g. ``"/run/mount/rauc/rootfs.1"``

    For mountable slots, i.e. those with a file system type, RAUC will attempt
    to automatically mount the slot if a pre-install or post-install hook is
    given and provide the slot's current mount point under this env variable.

  ``RAUC_IMAGE_NAME``
    If set, the file name of the image currently to be installed,
    e.g. ``"product-rootfs.img"``

  ``RAUC_IMAGE_DIGEST``
    If set, the digest of the image currently to be installed,
    e.g. ``"e29364a81c542755fd5b2c2461cd12b0610b67ceacabce41c102bba4202f2b43"``

  ``RAUC_IMAGE_CLASS``
    If set, the target class of the image currently to be installed,
    e.g. ``"rootfs"``

  ``RAUC_MOUNT_PREFIX``
    The global RAUC mount prefix path, e.g. ``"/run/mount/rauc"``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

Contains the information RAUC uses to identify the booted slot. It is derived
from the kernel command line.
This can either be the slot name (e.g. ``rauc.slot=rootfs.0``) or the root device
path (e.g. ``root=PARTUUID=0815``). If the ``root=`` kernel command line option is
used, the symlink is resolved to the block device (e.g. ``/dev/mmcblk0p1``).


RAUC's Basic Update Procedure
-----------------------------

Performing an update using the default RAUC mechanism will work as follows:

1. Startup, read system configuration
#. Determine slot states
#. Verify bundle signature (reject if invalid)
#. Mount bundle (SquashFS)
#. Parse and verify manifest
#. Determine target install group

   A. Execute `pre install handler` (optional)

#. Verify bundle compatible against system compatible (reject if not matching)
#. Mark target slots as non-bootable for bootloader
#. Iterate over each image specified in the manifest

   A. Determine update handler (based on image and slot type)
   #. Try to mount slot and read slot status information

      a. Skip update if new image hash matches hash of installed one

   #. Perform slot update (image copy / mkfs+tar extract / ...)
   #. Try to write slot status information

#. Mark target slots as new primary boot source for the bootloader

   A. Execute `post install` handler (optional)

#. Unmount bundle
#. Terminate successfully if no error occurred

.. _bootloader-interaction:

Bootloader Interaction
----------------------

RAUC comes with a generic interface for interacting with the bootloader.
It handles *all* slots that have a `bootname` property set.

It provides two base functions:

1) Setting state 'good' or 'bad', reflected by API routine `r_boot_set_state()`
   and command line tool option `rauc status mark <good/bad>`
2) Marking a slot 'primary', reflected by API routine `r_boot_set_primary()`
   and command line tool option `rauc status mark-active`

The default flow of how they will be called during the installation of a new
bundle (on Slot 'A') looks as follows:

.. image:: images/bootloader-interaction_install.svg
  :width: 400
  :align: center

The aim of setting state 'bad' is to disable a slot in a way that the
bootloader will not select it for booting anymore.
As shown above this is either the case before an installation to make the
update atomic from the bootloader's perspective, or optionally after the
installation and a reboot into the new system, when a service detects that the
system is in an unusable state. This potentially allows falling back to a
working system.

The aim of setting a slot 'primary' is to let the bootloader select this slot
upon next reboot in case of having completed the installation successfully.
An alternative to directly marking a slot primary after installation is to
manually mark it primary at a later point in time, e.g. to let a complete set
of devices change their software revision at the same time.

Setting the slot 'good' is relevant for the first boot but for all subsequent
boots, too.
In most cases, this interaction with the bootloader is required by the
mechanism that enables fallback capability; rebooting a system one or several times
without calling `rauc status mark-good` will
let the bootloader boot an alternative system or abort boot operation
(depending on configuration).
Usually, bootloaders implement this fallback mechanism by some kind of counters
they maintain and decrease upon each boot.
In these cases *marking good* means resetting these counters.

A normal reboot of the system will look as follows:

.. image:: images/bootloader-interaction_boot.svg
  :width: 400
  :align: center

Some bootloaders do not require explicitly setting state 'good' as they are able
to differentiate between a POR and a watchdog reset, for example.

.. note: Despite the naming might suggest it, marking a slot bad and good are
  not reversible operations, meaning you have no guarantee that a slot first
  set to 'bad' and then set to 'good' again will be in the same state as
  before.
  Actually reactivating it will only work by marking it primary (active).

What the high-level functions described above actually do mainly depends on the underlying
bootloader used and the capabilities it provides.
Below is a short description about behavior of each bootloader interface
currently implemented:

U-Boot
~~~~~~

The U-Boot implementation assumes to have variables `BOOT_ORDER` and
`BOOT_x_ATTEMPTS` handled by the bootloader scripting.

:state bad:
  Sets the `BOOT_x_ATTEMPTS` variable of the slot to `0` and removes it from
  the `BOOT_ORDER` list

:state good:
  Sets the `BOOT_x_ATTEMPTS` variable back to its default value (`3`).

:primary:
  Moves the slot from its current position in the list in `BOOT_ORDER` to the
  first place and sets `BOOT_x_ATTEMPTS` to its initial value (`3`).
  If BOOT_ORDER was unset before, it generates a new list of all slots known to
  RAUC with the one to activate at the first position.


Barebox
~~~~~~~

The barebox implementation assumes using
`barebox bootchooser <https://barebox.org/doc/latest/user/bootchooser.html>`_.

:state bad:
  Sets both the `bootstate.systemX.priority` and
  `bootstate.systemX.remaining_attempts` to `0`.

:state good:
  Sets the `bootstate.systemX.remaining_attempts` to its default value
  (`3`).

:primary:
  Sets `bootstate.systemX.priority` to `20` and all other priorities that were
  non-zero before to `10`.
  It also sets `bootstate.systemX.remaining_attempts` to its initial value (`3`).

GRUB
~~~~

:state bad:
  Sets slot `x_OK` to `0` and resets `x_TRY` to `0`.

:state good:
  Sets slot `x_OK` to `1` and resets `x_TRY` to `0`.

:primary:
  Sets slot `x_OK` to `1` and resets `x_TRY` to `0`.
  Sets `ORDER` to contain slot ``x`` as first element and all other after.

EFI
~~~

:state bad:
  Removes the slot from `BootOrder`

:state good:
  Prepends the slot to the `BootOrder` list.
  This behaves slightly different than the other implementations because we use
  `BootNext` for allowing setting primary with an initial fallback option.
  Setting state good is then used to persist this.

:primary:
  Sets the slot as `BootNext` by default.
  This will make the slot being booted upon next reboot only!

  The behavior is different when ``efi-use-bootnext`` is set to ``false``.
  Then this prepends the slot to the `BootOrder` list as described for 'state
  good'.

.. note:: EFI implementations differ in how they handle new or unbootable
  targets etc. It may also depend on the actual implementation if EFI variable
  writing is atomic or not.
  Thus make sure your EFI works as expected and required.
