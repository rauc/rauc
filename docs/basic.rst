RAUC Basics
===========

From a top view, the RAUC update framework provides a solution for four basic
tasks:

* generating update artifacts
* signing and verification of update artifacts
* robust installation handling
* interfacing with the boot process

RAUC is basically an image-based updater, i.e. it installs file images on
devices or partitions.
But, for target devices that can have a file system, it also supports
installing contents from tar archives.
This often provides much more flexibility as a tar does not have to fit a
specific partition size or type.
RAUC ensures that the target file system will be set up correctly before
unpacking the archive.

Update Artifacts -- Bundles
---------------------------

In order to know how to pack multiple file system images, properly handle
installation, being able to check system compatibility and for other
meta-information RAUC uses a well-defined update artifact format, simply
referred to as *bundles* in the following.


A RAUC bundle consists of the file system image(s) or archive(s) to be installed
on the system, a *manifest* that lists the images to install and contains
options and meta-information, and possible scripts to run before, during or
after installation.

To pack this all together, the default bundle format uses SquashFS.
This provides good compression while allowing to mount the bundle without
having to unpack it on the target system.
This way, no additional intermediate storage is required.

A key design decision of RAUC is that signing a bundle is mandatory.
For development purpose a self-signed certificate might be sufficient,
for production the signing process should be integrated with your PKI
infrastructure.

.. important:: A RAUC Bundle should always unambiguously describe the
  intended target state of the entire system.


RAUC's System View
------------------

Apart from bundle signing and verification, the main task of RAUC is to ensure
that all images in your update bundle are copied in the proper way to the proper
target device / partition on your board.

In order to allow RAUC to handle your device right, we need to give it the
right view on your system.

Slots
-----

In RAUC, everything that can be updated is a *slot*.
Thus a slot can either be a full device, a partition, a volume or simply a file.

To let RAUC know which slots exists on the board that should be handled,
the slots must be configured in a *system configuration file*.
This file is the central instance that tells RAUC how to handle the board, which
bootloader to use, which custom scripts to execute, etc.

The slot description names, for example, the file path the slot can be accessed
with, the type of storage or filesystem to use, its identification from the
bootloader, etc.

Target Slot Selection
---------------------

A very important step when installing an update is to determine the correct
mapping from the images that are contained in a RAUC bundle to the slots that
are defined on the target system.
The updated must also assure to select an inactive slot, and not accidentally a
slot the system currently runs from.

For this mapping, RAUC allows to define different *slot classes*.
A class describes always multiple redundant slots of the same type.
This can be, for example, a class for root file system slots or a
class for application slots.

Note that despite the fact that classic A+B redundancy is a common setup for
many systems, RAUC conceptually allows any number of redundant slots per class.

Now, multiple slots of different classes can be grouped as a *slot group*.
Such a group is the base for the slot selection algorithm of RAUC.

Consider, for example, a system with two redundant rootfs slots and two
redundant application slots. Then you group them together to have a fixed set
of a rootfs and application slot each that will be used together.

To detect the active slots, RAUC attempts to detect the currently booted slot.
For this, it relies on explicit mapping information provided via kernel command
line or attempts to find it out using mount information.

All slots of the group containing the active slot will be considered active,
too.

Slot Status and Skipping Slot Updates
-------------------------------------

RAUC hashes each image or archive when packing it into a bundle and stores this
hash in the bundle's manifest file.
This hash allows to reliably identify and distinguish the image's content.

When installing an image to a writable file system, RAUC will write an
additional slot status file after having completed the write operation
successfully.
This file contains the slots hash.

The next time RAUC attempts to install an image to this slot, it will first
check the current hash of the slot by reading its status file, if possible.
If this hash equals the hash of the image to write, RAUC will skip updating this
slot as a performance optimization.

This is especially useful when having a setup with, for example, two redundant
application file systems and two redundant root file systems. In case you
update the application file system content much more frequently, RAUC will save
update time by skipping the root file system automatically and only installing
the changed application.

Boot Slot Selection
-------------------

A system designed to run from redundant slots must always have a component that
is responsible for selecting between the bootable slots.
Usually, this will be some kind of bootloader, but it could also be an initramfs
booting a special purpose Linux system.

Of course, as a normal user-space tool, RAUC cannot do the selection itself, but
provides a well-defined interface and abstraction for interacting with different
bootloaders (e.g. GRUB, Barebox, U-Boot) or boot selection methods.

.. image:: images/bootloader_interface.svg

In order to enable RAUC to switch the correct slot, its system configuration
must specify the name of the respective slot from the bootloader's perspective.
You also have to set up an appropriate boot selection logic in the bootloader
itself, either by scripting (as for GRUB, U-Boot) or by using dedicated boot
selection infrastructure (such as bootchooser in Barebox).

The bootloader must also provide a set of variables the Linux userspace can
modify in order to change boot order or priority.

Having this interface ready, RAUC will care for setting the boot logic
appropriately.
It will, for example, deactivate the slot to update before writing to it
and reactivate it after having completed the installation successfully.

Installation and Storage Handling
---------------------------------

As mentioned above, RAUC basically writes images to devices or partitions, but
also allows installing file system content from (compressed) tar archives.

In addition to the need for different methods to write to storage (simple copy
for block devices, nandwrite for NAND, ubiupdatevol for UBI volumes, â€¦) the
tar-based installation requires additional handling and preparation of storage.

Thus, the possible and required handling depends on both the type of input
image (e.g. .tar.xz, .ext4, .img) as well as the type of storage.
A tar can be installed on different file systems while an ext4 file system slot
might be filled by both an .ext4 image or a tar archive.

To deal with all these possible combinations, RAUC provides an update handler
algorithm that uses a matching table to define valid combinations of image and
slot type while specifying the appropriate handling.

Boot Confirmation & Fallback
----------------------------

When designing a robust redundant system, update handling does not end with the
successful installation of the update on the target slots!
Having written your image data without any errors does not mean that the system
you just installed will really boot.
And even if it boots, there may be crashes or invalid behavior only revealed
at runtime or possibly not before a number of days and reboots.

To allow the boot logic to detect if booting a slot succeeded or failed,
it needs to receive some feedback from the booted system.
For marking a boot as either successful or bad, RAUC provides the commands
`status mark-good` and `status mark-bad`.
These commands interact through the boot loader interface with the respective
bootloader implementation to indicate a successful or failed boot.

As detecting an invalid boot is often not possible, i.e. because simply nothing
boots or the booted system suddenly crashes, your system should use a hardware
watchdog to during boot and have support in the bootloader to detect watchdog
resets as failed boots.

Also you need to define what happens when a boot slot is detected to be
unusable.
For most cases it might be desired to either select one of the redundant slots
as fallback or boot into a recovery system.
This handling is up to your bootloader.
