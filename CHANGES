Release 1.16 (development)
--------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add support for polling based on the existing HTTP(S) streaming (see
  :ref:`sec-polling`).
  The polling functionality in RAUC allows a device to periodically check for
  updates from a specified URL.
  It fetches bundle manifests, checks for available updates, and initiates
  installations if necessary.
  This functionality is intended to automate the update process and ensure that
  the system remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

Release 1.15.1 (released Jan 5, 2026)
-------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix compatibility with new dm-verity status output since Linux v6.19-rc1.
  (in :pr:`1846`)
* Explicitly handle the case where images have neither a ``type`` nor a
  ``filename`` option. (in :pr:`1829`)
* Ignore ``SIGINT`` (Ctrl+C) during installation in the non-service case.
  This ensures that the normal cleanup of mounts and device-mapper devices
  happens when the installation completes.
  When using the systemd service, the cleanup is already handled via a mount
  namespace and device dependencies. (in :pr:`1849`)

.. rubric:: Testing

* Simplify interactive testing of encrypted bundles by configuring an encryption
  key and cert for ``./qemu-test system``. (in :pr:`1845`)

.. rubric:: Code

* Improve handling of ``--keyring`` and ``--signing-keyring`` options.
  (in :pr:`1828`)

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Update sphinx dependencies to current versions. (in :pr:`1843`)
* Document the ``raw`` image ``type`` correctly. (in :pr:`1827`)
* Fix some outdated information in the terminology chapter. (in :pr:`1831`)
* Fix monospaced formatting in the reference chapter. (in :pr:`1848`)

Release 1.15 (released Nov 7, 2025)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add an optional ``type=`` to images in the bundle manifest.
  This can be used to define the type explicitly, which is useful if the file
  name extension is not known to RAUC.
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <sec-ref-supported-image-types>`.
  (by Lars Schmidt in :pr:`1756`)
* Add support for an ``emptyfs`` image type, which can be used instead of an
  emtpy ``tar`` when installing into an ``ext4`` slot.
  The newly created filesystem can then be customised with a ``post-install``
  hook.
  (by Lars Schmidt in :pr:`1759`)
* The HTTP headers enabled by the ``send-headers`` option in the
  ``[streaming]`` section are now also sent for ``rauc info``/
  ``InspectBundle()`` as well.
  When using the service, this applies also to `custom HTTP headers
  <https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#handlers-section>`_ set
  by the ``system-info`` handler.
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <send-headers>`.
* Support sending a ``RAUC-System-Version`` HTTP header in the initial
  streaming/inspect request. (in :pr:`1654`)
* Set up group memberships of the streaming helper process to allow access to
  required resources (such as a mTLS private key). (by Omri Sarig in :pr:`1695`)
* Improve booted slot detection on UEFI systems by reading the ``BootCurrent``
  variable. (by Pavel Löbl in :pr:`1696`)
* Refactor boot slot detection to prioritize explicit information from the
  bootloader backend above the ``root=`` kernel commandline parameter. (in
  :pr:`1712`)
* Introduce the ``allowed-signer-cns`` configuration option to restrict which
  certificates are accepted when verifying bundle signatures using a list of
  CommonNames. (by Lars Schmidt in :pr:`1710`)
* Allow (non-hidden) directories as bundle contents.
  Hidden directories are reserved for internal use by RAUC. (by Jens Kehne in
  :pr:`1625`)
* Produce progress updates for adaptive updates during block-hash-index
  generation. (in :pr:`1734`)
* Support a ``size-limit`` configuration option for the ``boot-emmc`` slot
  type.
  This can be used in cases where unrelated data on the eMMC boot partitions
  must be preserved and migrating it to a dedicated location is not feasible.
  Also ensure that the image fits into the slot before attempting to write it.
  (in :pr:`1740`)
* Improve handling of A/B/C setups by selecting the slot group with the oldest
  installation date. (in :pr:`1525`)
* Handle config overrides set via ``-C``/``--confopt`` even if no config file is
  available. (in :pr:`1763`)
* Implement support for appending signatures to existing bundles with ``rauc
  resign``.
  This needs new APIs in OpenSSL to become useful.
  (in :pr:`1810`)

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Avoid race with udev during NBD setup. (by Michael Olbrich in :pr:`1741`)
* Fix memory leak on ``G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE`` in ``clear_slot()``. (by Jialu
  Zhou in :pr:`1706`)
* Improve error handling for manually modified bundles with unaligned payload.
  (by Janek Filus in :pr:`1728`)
* Check exit code of ``barebox-state``.
  This improves the error message printed by RAUC in cases where
  ``barebox-state`` fails.
  (in :pr:`1781`)
* Fix double close of socket if NBD startup fails. (by Gaël PORTAY in
  :pr:`1790`)
* Fix use of PKCS#11-backed keys with streaming. (by Giacomo Dal Sasso in
  :pr:`1813`)

.. rubric:: Testing

* Fix test failures with OpenSSL 3.5, which were caused by repeated
  initialization.
* Add a CI run for Debian bookworm (currently oldstable) and run the test suite
  for some stable distributions.
* Fix a test case incompatible with ``squashfs-tools`` >= 4.7.
* Fix a compatibility issue with OpenSC => 0.26.0. (by Lars Schmidt in
  :pr:`1783`)
* Add minimal test case for barebox bootloader backend. (in :pr:`1782`)
* Complete test cases for ``get_update_handler()``. (by Lars Schmidt in
  :pr:`1788`)
* Improve handling of test logs when using ``qemu-test``.
* Fix handling of coverage data if ``setfacl`` is not available. (by Gaël PORTAY
  in :pr:`1789`)
* Add a Python helper to decode CMS structures and check signing time in bundle
  signature with it. (in :pr:`1790`)
* Add test cases for streaming with TLS client authentication using PEM files
  and PKCS#11 keys.  (in :pr:`1816`)

.. rubric:: Code

* Support building without OpenSSL PKCS#11 engine support. (by Bruno Thomsen in
  :pr:`1690`)
* Improve log messages when marking slots as (non-)bootable. (by Leon Anavi in
  :pr:`1735`)
* Use explicit boolean default values in ``meson_options.txt``. (by Lars Schmidt
  in :pr:`1743`)
* Simplify the ``boot-emmc`` update handler to use ``copy_raw_image_to_dev()``.
* Some preparations (ETag based caching) for native polling in the service (in
  :pr:`1700`)
* Some preparations for multiple signature support in the CMS handling code.
* Explicitly license the D-Bus introspection data as CC0-1.0 to avoid some
  friction when packaging RAUC.
* More error checking for incorrect use of the context and progress APIs.
* Refactor ``system.conf`` parsing into one function per section.  (in
  :pr:`1763`)
* Refactor service startup. (in :pr:`1804` and :pr:`1818`)
* Clean up remaining ``g_autofree`` variable initialization. (by Gaël PORTAY in
  :pr:`1815`)
* Minor code cleanups (return handling, g_auto).

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Convert manual page source to rst and build it using sphinx.
  This also allows us to show it in the `HTML documentation
  <https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html>`_.
  Due to the additional dependency, it is no longer built and installed by
  default, though.
  Pass ``-Dmanpages=true`` to meson to re-enable this.
* Fix the selection logic in the ``grub.cfg`` example code. (by Linus Wallgren
  in :pr:`1702`)
* Update the description of booted slot detection.
* Document which options support binary size suffixes.
* Fix some minor inconsistencies and missing details.
* Fix name of event log ``format`` option. (by Grégoire Duvauchelle in :pr:`1793`)
* Link (some) PRs from the changelog and disable unused Sphinx extensions.

Release 1.14 (released Apr 2, 2025)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add support for `composefs <https://github.com/containers/composefs>`_ artifacts.
  composefs combines `overlayfs
  <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html>`_, `EROFS
  <https://erofs.docs.kernel.org>`_ and optionally `fs-verity
  <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html>`_ into an
  authenticated read-only filesystem with content-addressed file data.

  The use-cases for this are very similar to the existing ``tree`` type, but as
  composefs stores file data separately from metadata, every unique file content
  is stored in the repository only once and is installed from the bundle only
  once. This also reduces the amount of data downloaded when using streaming.
  (in :pr:`1500`)
* Add ``prevent-late-fallback=true/false`` option to control whether ``rauc
  status mark-good`` disables the old slot.
  This prevents fallback to an older version must be prevented after the update
  is completed successfully. (by Fabian Pfitzner in :pr:`1584`)
* Show detailed installation progress for images using block hash indices. (by
  Marcus Hoffmann in :pr:`1619`)
* Add support to the ``system-info`` handler to provide a "system version".
  (in :pr:`1621`)
* Expose ``RAUC_TRANSACTION_ID`` to full custom and system pre/post-install
  handlers. (by Peter Korsgaard in :pr:`1626`)
* Add a ``min-rauc-version`` property in the bundle manifest.
  This gives us an additional way to ensure that bundles are not installed by an
  incompatible version. (in :pr:`1643`)
* Make the maximum signature (CMS structure) size configurable from
  ``system.conf``.
  This makes it possible to use a large number of recipients when encrypting
  bundles. (in :pr:`1642`)
* Add support for requiring a specific manifest hash during installation.
  (in :pr:`1645`)

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix two memory leaks in error handling. (by Gaël PORTAY)
* Fix installation of plain bundles on kernels configured without
  ``CONFIG_BLK_DEV_WRITE_MOUNTED`` by opening the loop device read-only. (by Sascha
  Hauer)
* Fix a null pointer dereference if the mounted bundle is inaccessible. (by
  Aly Ammar)

.. rubric:: Testing

* Clean up ``qemu-test-init`` and fix compatibility on systems which use ``bash`` as
  ``sh``. (by Gaël PORTAY)
* Migrate from pydbus to dasbus for testing D-Bus APIs using pytest.
* Fix detection of ASAN issues in the D-Bus service when using pytest.

.. rubric:: Code

* Update minimum glib version to 2.64.0.

* Improve error message if the kernel does not support SquashFS.
* Simplify detection of NFS/external boot.
* Simplify internal handling of incremental progress updates.
* Ignore a ``rollout`` section in the manifest to improve compatibility of
  future bundles.
* Remove unnecessary gotos. (by Gaël PORTAY)

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Warn against creating production PKIs by using ``test/openssl-ca-create.sh``,
  as it's intended to exercise many different code paths in the test suite.
* Clean up the D-Bus API reference (see :ref:`sec_ref_dbus-api`).
* Fix override syntax and recipe names in the Yocto integration example. (by
  Antonin Godard)
* Mention the AWS IoT Greengrass Lite as a deployment server. (by Thomas Roos)
* Remove custom sphinx/pygments Devicetree lexer and use the built-in one.

Release 1.13 (released Jan 22, 2025)
------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add support for :ref:`artifact repositories <sec-basic-artifact-repositories>`
  as a preview.

  Bundles can now contain *artifacts* (containers, VM images, large data files,
  firmware images for other systems and micro-controllers, and other add-on
  binaries).
  Artifacts are installed into *repositories*, which are directories on a
  partition shared between all slots.
  Artifact updates provide flexibility by allowing repositories
  :ref:`configured <sec-repository-config>` in the ``system.conf`` to contain
  multiple artifacts.

  Multiple :ref:`types of repositories <sec-repository-types>` are available for
  different use cases, such as files or directory trees, and the type determines
  how artifact are installed and managed.

  We expect that additional types will be added as needed to support adaptive
  updates for artifacts and deduplicated storage (e.g. using `composefs
  <https://github.com/containers/composefs>`_) in the future.

  .. note::

    Artifact updates are currently available at a preview level.

    This means that we want to allow users to try out this new feature and report
    their experiences, but also that your use case (such as parent slot classes
    for artifacts) may not be fully supported yet.
    Depending on the feedback, we may need to change behaviour in ways that are
    not backwards compatible.
    So, try it out and report back `using GitHub discussions
    <https://github.com/rauc/rauc/discussions/categories/artifact-updates>`_ or
    in the `Matrix/IRC chat channel <https://matrix.to/#/#rauc:matrix.org>`_, but
    don't rely on it for products yet.
    We intend to stabilize this feature as soon as we have confidence that the
    common use cases work well.

* Expose manifest meta-data to handlers and the ``install-check`` hook as
  environment variables.
  This uses the same variable names (and implementation) as ``rauc info
  --output-format=shell``.
* Allow local symlinks in the bundle again.
* Support locating ``system.conf`` in ``/usr/lib/rauc`` and ``/run/rauc``
  according to the `UAPI Group's "Configuration Files Specification"
  <https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/configuration_files_specification/>`_.
  (by Ahmad Fatoum)
* Add support for adding and overriding system config options from the command
  line using ``-C``/``--confopt``. (by Christian Aurich)
* Expose the ``RAUC_SYSTEM_VARIANT`` for handlers as well. (by Ahmad Fatoum)
* Print bootname in addition to the slot name in "checking slot" progress
  messages. (by Richard Alpe)
* Allow ``tftp://`` URLs for bundle download (but not for streaming). (by
  Joachim Wiberg)
* Log how much of the bundle was downloaded when streaming.
  This is useful to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive update.
* Log stats even if the NBD server exits with an error.
* Added a simple shell-based update service as an example in
  ``contrib/rauc-client/``. (by Angelo Compagnucci)
* Reject slots with both ``install`` and ``pre-install`` (or ``post-install``)
  hooks set during creation, as only the ``install`` hook would be used.
* Add more pre-condition checks to the eMMC boot partition support.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix handling of failed installations in combination with
  ``install-same=false``. (by Samer Kenawy)
* Fix double file descriptor close when creating adaptive bundles.
  This bug resulted in an abort when using glib since version 2.75.0.
* Require at least one recipient certificate when encrypting bundles. (by
  Florian Otte)
* Fix error handling when using URLs with disabled network/streaming support.
  (by Ahmad Fatoum)
* Fix CMS debug output with ``G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all``. (by Tamara Schmitz)
* Add missing Qt D-Bus type annotation. (by Richard Hozák)
* Fix casync archive generation when running under ``pseudo`` by avoiding
  ``fakeroot`` in that case.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Add helper scripts to save and clear coverage data when running under
  ``qemu-test``.
* Fix service shutdown to improve coverage reporting.
* Update codecov CI integration to fix coverage reports and use different flags
  for with/without D-Bus service builds.
* Improve test coverage for:

  * decryption via PKCS#11
  * detailed status output in all formats
  * ``rauc write-slot``
  * boot slot detection via ``PARTLABEL``, ``PARTUUID`` and ``UUID``
  * eMMC boot partitions by using emulation in QEMU
  * boot/slot status changes

  We now have `almost 85% coverage
  <https://app.codecov.io/gh/rauc/rauc?trend=12%20months>`_ and mainly
  hard-to-test syscall error handling code remains.
* Use pytest ``tmp_path`` fixture to improve test case isolation.
* Avoid pulling in X11 dependencies via dbus-launch and use dbus-daemon instead.
* Fix startup of ``qemu-test`` in cases where the host has a
  ``/etc/resolv.conf`` symlink.
* Fix upload of ``scan-build`` reports in CI.
* Fix testing of encrypted bundle extraction.
* Enable tests with disabled GPT support in CI.
* Refactor fixtures for more flexible system context setup and config
  generation.
  This made some fixed config files obsolete, which were removed.

.. rubric:: Code

Release 1.12 (released Aug 9, 2024)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add a ``min-bundle-version`` using SemVer format in ``system.conf``.
  This causes RAUC to reject bundles with an older version. (by Johannes
  Schneider)
* Avoid modifying the input directory during ``rauc bundle`` by using a
  hard-linked copy.
  For simplicity, we abort on anything in the input directory which is not a
  regular file.
  If someone relies on the old (undocumented) behavior of including directories
  and symlinks in the bundle, please contact us.
* Allow configuration of additional mkfs options per slot using
  ``extra-mkfs-opts=<options>`` in ``system.conf``. (by David Robertson)
* Improve messages printed when aborting ``rauc install`` with Ctrl+C.
* Add the manifest build value to the hook execution environment. (by Heiko
  Thiery)
* Add the bundle format to the ``rauc info`` shell and JSON formatters. (by
  Peter Korsgaard)
* Add a systemd `journald message catalog
  <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/catalog/>`_.
* Allow plain bundles on ntfs3 mounts.

* Warn when using slower HTTP/1 instead of HTTP/2 for streaming.
* Improve messages and errors printed for hash index generation and make some
  more visible.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix handling of slot installation skipping with global slot status and add a
  test case.
* Fix PKCS11 URI handling in ``system.conf``. (by David Hollister)
* Fix block-hash-index cache by not cleaning and properly re-using the slot's
  data directory during installation.
  This avoids redundant slot scans to find reusable blocks during installation.
* Fix out-of-bounds reads in bootchooser backends.
* Fix some memory leaks in the NBD helper, D-Bus service, CLI and tests.
* Fix logging of the BUNDLE_HASH and SLOT_BOOTNAME values in the booted event.

  casync. (by Tim van der Staaij)
* Add missing "PRIORITY" field in event log messages.
* Improve NBD helper shutdown error handling.
* Fix inconsistent default D-Bus policy installation directory.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Replace sharness with pytest.
  This will make it easier to write and maintain complex test cases.
* Execute tests for ARMv5/7/8 and i386 using QEMU and multi-arch containers.
* Enable address sanitizer for all remaining tests.

Release 1.11.3 (released Mar 15, 2024)
--------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix service startup when using symlinks in ``system.conf`` and ``root=`` in
  the kernel commandline.
  Systems using ``rauc.slot=<bootname>`` or ``bootchooser.active=<bootname>``
  are not affected.

Contributions from: Arseniy Lartsev, Enrico Jörns, Jan Lübbe

Release 1.11 (released Dec 20, 2023)
------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Send :ref:`additional information as HTTP headers
  <sec-additional-http-headers>` to the server on the first streaming request
  (if enabled in the config).
* Add persistent system status information to detect reboots using the kernel's
  ``boot_id``.
* Add an ``--ignore-image=<slotclass>`` option to keep images as they are when
  using ``rauc convert``.
  This can be used to exclude some images (such as bootloaders) from the casync
  conversion.
* Create :ref:`links for active slot devices <sec-run-links>` in
  ``/run/rauc/slots/active``.
  This should avoid the need for parsing 'rauc status' output in some cases.
* Expose transaction ID to hooks during installation. (by Zygmunt Krynicki)
* Add support for ``get-current`` to the custom bootloader backend. (by Angelo
  Compagnucci)
* Implement ``resign`` and ``replace-signature`` for encrypted bundles.
* Explicit ``rauc status`` output when no slot is activated (instead of
  printing ``null``).
* Detect runtime config file change and warn in the service log.
* Improve various warning and error messages to better guide users. (by
  Angelo Compagnucci and others)
* Remove autotools build system.
  Support for meson was added in 1.9 and supported in parallel to autotools
  until 1.10.1.
* Add log events for slot update, start/end of an installation, good/bad/active
  marking and boot/service restart.
  For an overview over the event logging framework in RAUC and its purpose, have
  a look at :ref:`sec-advanced-event-log`.

.. note::
   We don't consider the details of the new log events fixed yet, so please use
   them as a preview and for testing.
   In a future release, they will be documented in a `journald message catalog
   <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/catalog/>`_.

  InspectBundle D-Bus method structure.
* Improve error message for failed boot slot detection.
* Allow exFAT as a local filesystem for plain bundles. (by Stefan Wahren)
* Add optional pre-check for verity bundles.
  This is useful if the same bundle needs to be transferred and installed to
  multiple systems in sync. (by Christian Hitz)
* Add support for custom variables in the system-info handler and pass them to
  other handlers.
* Show a warning during bundle creation if no format is specified in the
  manifest.
  This should hopefully encourage migration to the verity format.
* Introduce an installation transaction UUID, which is stored in the slot
  status.
  This can be used to infer which slots have been updated by the same
  transaction.
  In a future release, this will be useful to correlate log messages.
* Use a shorter connect timeout for streaming to avoid waiting for 25 minutes.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix some issues in the meson build support:

  * missing man page installation
  * missing dependency for tests on D-Bus header generation
  * missing executable bit for D-Bus wrapper ``rauc-service.sh``
* Fix external mount point detection which could have caused a number of mounts
  to be not detected properly.
* Fix double-initialization of context.
* Fix memory leaks (mainly in the test suite).
* Fix a confusing error message when using ``rauc extract`` with an existing
  output directory.
* Fix building with musl by not using ``off64_t`` with
  ``_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64``. (by Christian Hohnstaedt)
* Fix unintentional forwarding of full custom handler args (defined in
  the manifest) to the ``system.conf``-defined handlers.
* Re-add missing ``--key`` argument (used to set the decryption key) to help
  and man page.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Add Debian 'buster', 'bullseye' and 'testing' to test stable test matrix.
* Add test run with address sanitizer.
  This currently uses a large part of the existing test suite.

.. rubric:: Code

* Refactor installation handling with the introduction of installation plans.
  This also allows testing for invalid image/slot combinations earlier.
* Add a helper for atomic symlink updates.
* Refactor slot state determination and split from mount point updates.
  Let slot state determination happen earlier and only once.
* Require at least glib 2.56.0 for ``g_ptr_array_find`` and ``g_autolist``.
  Debian buster, Ubuntu bionic and Yocto dunfell have newer versions already.
* Refactor boot slot marking.
* Consistently initialize variables to avoid static checker warning. (by
  b4yuan)

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Document some Linux distributions which provide RAUC packages.
* Document deprecation of the ``statusfile`` option. (by Ulrich Ölmann)
* Extend and fix documentation for the full custom handler.

Release 1.9 (released Mar 3, 2023)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add new InspectBundle D-Bus method, which takes the same bundle access options
  as the existing InstallBundle method.
  This makes it possible to inspect bundles stored on HTTP servers which need
  authentication.
  It returns information from the manifest as a nested dictionary (for now,
  this is only ``compatible``, ``version``, ``description`` and ``build``), but
  can be extended as needed.
  (by Stefan Ursella)
* Add support for loading and storing metadata entries in the manifest.
  They are not yet exposed to the user.
* Add a manifest hash value and expose it via ``rauc info`` and ``rauc status``.
  This can be used to identify a specific bundle.
* Support configurable boot attempt counters for barebox (using
  ``boot-attempts`` in the ``system.conf``).
* Add meson as an alternative build system.
  We intend to drop autotools in 1.10, unless there are good reasons to keep it
  for longer.
  As the tar archive generated by meson does not contain a configure script,
  you may need to run autogen.sh to generate it.
  To simplify the migration, we also provide a ``-autotools`` archive variant
  which is generated using autotool's ``make dist`` (and does not contain the
  meson build support).
* Abort earlier if the image is too large for the target slot.
* Add warnings for some configuration issues when using adaptive updates.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix a NULL dereference error caused by images larger than the target slot. (by
  Kevin Hsieh)
* Fix compatibility with libcurl when built without proxy support. (by Christian
  Meusel)
* Do not invoke any target-related context setup steps if no config is required.
  This avoids unnecessary checks and removes the misleading messages about
  unresolved paths.
* Fix number format for bootchooser when using U-Boot. (by Christian Meusel)
* Fix handling of partitioned loop devices, which caused incorrect aborts
  during installation.
* Fix error handling when attempting to encrypt plain bundles.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Improve robustness of dm-verity/-crypt test setup.
* Enable scan-build for tests in GitHub Actions.
* Handle floating point comparisons in tests better.
* Add a GitHub Actions workflow for CodeQL scanning as a replacement for LGTM.
* Run the cross architecture tests on Debian bullseye instead of buster.

.. rubric:: Code

* Move the ``-intermediate`` option to the subcommand level and update the
  manual page.
* Improve error handling for invalid ``boot-attempts`` configuration.
* Fix some minor memory leaks.

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Document our :ref:`approach to bundle compatibility <sec-compatibility>`.
* Add links to public example integrations of RAUC into different build systems
  and boards.
* Add an issue template and a SUPPORT.rst file.
* Improve the documentation on slot skipping with regard to streaming.
* Update README.rst with new features.

Release 1.8 (released Sep 30, 2022)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Implement adaptive image updates based on block hash indices.
  This works by adding an index file containing the hashes of each 4kiB image
  block in the image to the bundle and then using this to check whether a block
  is available locally during installation.
  If that's the case, RAUC doesn't need to download this block.
  Together with streaming, this means that only a small part of the bundle needs
  to be downloaded as long as the changes are localized.
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <sec-adaptive-updates>`.
* Add a slot type which provides atomic bootloader updates for SoCs (like the
  Rockchip RK3568) which search for a valid image at multiple fixed offsets. (by
  Matthias Fend)
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <sec-raw-partition-fallback>`.
* Add a configuration option for additional arguments to pass to ``casync
  extract``. (by Ludovico de Nittis)
* Add initial support for desync (an alternative casync implementation). (by
  Ludovico de Nittis)
* Add support for a RAUC data-directory on a shared partition.
  Unless otherwise configured, this is also used to store the central slot
  status data.
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <data-directory>`.
* Allow setting a passphrase for encrypted PEM files via the environment
  (``RAUC_KEY_PASSPHRASE``). (by Marc Kleine-Budde)
* Ignore ``meta.<label>`` sections in the manifest.
  The ``meta.<label>`` sections are intended to provide a forwards-compatible
  way to add data to the manifest which is not interpreted by RAUC in any way.
  Currently, they are just ignored when reading a manifest. In future releases,
  they will be accessible via ``rauc info``, the D-Bus API and in
  hooks/handlers.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Avoid retrying on HTTP 404 errors during streaming.
* Improve error handling during loop device block size configuration. (by Ahmad
  Fatoum)
* Fix handling of empty partitions for ``boot-mbr-switch`` slots.
* Do not attempt to take ownership of plain bundles if running as non-root.
* Unmount seed slots if casync fails during installation. (by Jonas Licht)
* Add missing test files to the dist .tar.xz. (by Uwe Kleine-König)

.. rubric:: Testing

* Refactor the statistics code to make it useful for testing as well.
* Replace Ubuntu 21.10 test container with 22.04
* Add more tests for casync conversion and installation.

.. rubric:: Code

* Log error messages from CURL for failed streaming requests.
* Add doctype to D-Bus XML specification. (by Morgan Bengtsson)
* Improve error messages related to bootloader communication.
* Improve error reporting for directory creation failures.

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Document that the required kernel features can be configured as modules as
  well.
* Document how to load and store the GRUB environment from a shared partition.
* Document some best practices regarding storage partitioning.
* Explain differences between casync and streaming & adaptive updates.

Release 1.7 (released Jun 3, 2022)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add support for streaming installation from a HTTP(S) server for bundles in
  ``verity`` and ``crypt`` formats.
  This avoids the need for a temporary bundle storage location and prepares for
  more efficient *adaptive* (originally *incremental*) updates.
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <http-streaming>`.
* Add support for bundle encryption (``crypt`` format).
  This is useful when bundles contain confidential data and are not otherwise
  protected during transport (for example, via HTTP, unauthenticated HTTPS or
  USB storage).
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <sec-encryption>`.
* Optionally allow verification with partial chains.
  If enabled, RAUC will also treat intermediate certificates in the keyring as
  trust-anchors, in addition to self-signed root CA certificates. This makes it
  possible to trust only one (or more) sub-tree(s) in a larger PKI.
  See the :ref:`documentation for details <allow-partial-chain>`.
* Divert log messages to stderr, which is useful for machine readable output
  (``rauc status --output-format=json``).
  This is only enabled when built with glib 2.68 or newer.
  (by Ludovico de Nittis)
* Only allow the root step to report 100% progress. (by Steven Rau)
* Add the ``--trust-environment`` option to ``rauc extract`` and ``rauc
  extract-signature``.
* Improve the error message printed on compatible mismatch.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Don't enforce bundle exclusivity if the environment is trusted. (by Ludovico
  de Nittis)
* Clean up error handling for 'rauc status'.
* Fix some memory leaks. (by Zygmunt Krynicki)
* Fix unintentional removal of existing bundles on error.
* Fix build error when PRIu64 is not defined. (by Fabrice Fontaine)

.. rubric:: Testing

* Make some tests conditional on the existence of the openssl binary.
* Access rauc.io instead of example.com.
* Explicitly use Python 3 in coverity checks. (by Thorsten Scherer)
* Add build tests on Ubuntu 21.10.

.. rubric:: Code

* Add some missing files to the dist tar.gz. (by Uwe Kleine-König)
* Change minimum glib version from 2.49.3 to 2.50, allowing use of g_autoptr
  with the auto-generated DBus code.
* Use g_autofree/g_autoptr in more places.
* Use more specific error codes for device mapper error reporting.
* Prepare for incremental methods by adding an optional per-image manifest
  option.

.. note::
  Since the release of 1.7, it turned out that the name 'incremental' for this
  functionality is confusing.
  Accordingly, we decided to rename it to 'adaptive' for 1.8 and accept the
  downside of not being able to benefit from compatibility with 1.7.

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Fix some broken internal links. (by Thorsten Scherer)
* Mention Buildroot support for RAUC. (by Thomas Petazzoni)
* Fix some typos. (by Bastian Krause and Michael Riesch)
* Clean up some inconsistencies between README and main documentation.
* Fix misleading rescue slot example. (by Sean Nyekjaer)
* Fix broken links to external pages. (by Bastian Krause)

  (by Arnaud Rebillout)
* Implemented passing additional information to hooks for the ``boot-*`` slot types.
  (by Bastian Krause)
* Added support for extracting and replacing the bundle signature, which is
  useful for scenarios with strict limitations on how HSMs can be used. (by
  Jean-Pierre Geslin)
* Implemented a ``rauc mount`` command to allow inspection of bundles without
  extraction.
* Allowed omitting the image filename when using the ``install`` slot hook.
* Implemented support for extracting tar archives to jffs2 slots. (by Holger Assmann)
* Added option for the ``resign`` and ``info`` commands to ignore expired
  certificates (``--no-check-time``). (by Michael Heimpold)
* Added option for the ``convert`` command to disable the concurrent access
  checks for plain bundles (``--trust-environment``).
* Simplified usage of compressed SquashFS images with extensions as created by
  OpenEmbedded. (by Omer Akram)
* Improved checks of the manifest contents to avoid common misconfigurations.
* Improved handling of ``system.conf`` loading according to the use-cases of
  the different commands.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

Release 1.5 (released Dec 14, 2020)
-----------------------------------

.. note::

  This version introduces the new ``verity`` bundle format (the old format is
  now called ``plain``).
  The ``verity`` format was added to prepare for future use cases (such as
  network streaming and encryption), for better parallelization of installation
  with hash verification and to detect modification of the bundle during
  installation (CVE-2020-25860).
  The bundle format is detected when reading a bundle and checked against the set
  of allowed formats configured in the system.conf (see :ref:`sec_ref_formats`).

  As the old ``plain`` format does not offer protection against modification
  during the installation process, RAUC now takes ownership of the bundle file,
  removes write permissions and checks for existing open file descriptors.
  This is intended as a mitigation to protect against a compromised update
  service running as a non-root user, which would otherwise be able to modify
  the bundle between signature check and actual bundle installation.

  See :ref:`sec_int_migration` for more details on how to switch to the
  ``verity`` format.

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add support for the ``verity`` bundle format. See the :ref:`reference for
  details <sec_ref_format_verity>`.
* Support resolving the `root=PARTLABEL=xxx` kernel command line option. (by
  Gaël PORTAY)
* Disable the unnecessary SMIMECapabilities information in the bundle
  signature, saving ~100 bytes.
* Remove redundant checksum verification for source images during installation.
  The RAUC bundle is already verified at this point, so there is no need to
  verify the checksum of each file individually. (by Bastian Krause)

.. rubric:: Security

* Take ownership of bundle files if they are not owned by root and remove write
  permissions. Then check that no writable file descriptors are open for the
  bundle file (using the ``F_SETLEASE`` fcntl). This fixes CVE-2020-25860. See
  the advisory for more details:
  https://github.com/rauc/rauc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgf3-h62j-w9vv

.. note::

  The https://github.com/rauc/rauc-1.5-integration repository contains examples
  to simplify integrating the RAUC update into existing projects.
  You can subscribe to https://github.com/rauc/rauc-1.5-integration/issues/1 to
  receive notifications of important updates to this repository and of
  integration into the upstream build systems.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix install handler selection for *.img files for boot-* slots when used with
  casync. (by Martin Schwan)
* Fix checking for unknown keys in the slot configuration.
* Fix some corner cases related to stopping the D-Bus daemon.
* Propagate error if unable to save manifest. (by Stefan Wahren)
* Apply `--handler-args` only during installation (and not during bundle
  creation).

.. rubric:: Testing

* Ship `test/minimal-test.conf` to fix testing when running as root. (by Uwe
  Kleine-König)
* Increase usage of g_autofree/g_autoptr in the test suite.

.. rubric:: Code

* Remove unused code for signed manifests (outside of a bundle).
* Add G_GNUC_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT to many functions.

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Fix multiple smaller errors. (by Christoph Steiger, Christopher Obbard and
  Michael Heimpold)
* Improve documentation related to u-boot scripting and environment storage.

Release 1.4 (released Jul 20, 2020)
-----------------------------------

.. note::

  Slots with both a ``parent=`` and a ``bootname=`` entry are now rejected when
  parsing the system configuration.
  While the intention was to have either a bootname or a parent link, this was
  not enforced in previous versions.
  Move the bootname to the parent slot when updating to RAUC 1.4.

  It is now recommended to explicitly select either per-slot or global
  configuration file in the system config using ``statusfile=<path>/per-slot``.
  If a central storage location is available, global status file should be
  preferred.

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Added support for custom boot selection scripts/binaries.
  This allows handling special cases where none of the standard bootloaders
  is available for switching the redundant slots. (by Christian Bräuner
  Sørensen, :ref:`docs <sec-custom-bootloader-backend>` by Andreas Schmidt)
* Changed ext4 filesystem creation options to always use 256 byte inodes.
  Without it, mkfs.ext4 will default to 128 byte inodes on filesystems smaller
  than 512MiB.
  This avoids the "ext4 filesystem being mounted at /foo supports timestamps
  until 2038" message on newer kernels.
* Added new slot type ``boot-gpt-switch`` to support atomic updating of boot
  partitions in the GPT.
  This is useful if the firmware does not support atomic bootloader updates by
  itself.
  See :ref:`here <sec-gpt-partition>` for details.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Improve parent and bootname consistency checks when loading the system
  config. (by Dan Callaghan)
* Fix and improve installation log output for the --disable-service
  configuration.
* Clean up incomplete bundles on creation errors consistently for extract/resign/convert
  and doesn't remove pre-existing files anymore.
* Fix minor memory leaks.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Added tests for UBIFS and NAND slot types via nandsim in qemu.
* Added CI testing of the --disable-service configure option.
* Added test cases for some CLI subcommands.

.. rubric:: Code

* Clarified licensing of the D-Bus API file. (by Michael Heimpold)

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Manual pages have been updated with new options. (by Michael Heimpold)
* Improved documentation around central and per-slot status files.
* Improved images and various text sections.

Junghans, Uwe Kleine-König

Release 1.3 (released Apr 23, 2020)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Added a new D-Bus method (InstallBundle) which supports optional parameters
  ("ignore-compatible" for now).
* Added support for X.509 key usage attributes (code signing and others).
* Added a ``check-crl`` configuration option to require Certificate Revocation
  List (CRL) checking during installation.
  If the keyring already contains a CRL, but checking is not enabled, a warning
  will be printed.
* Support updating of already mounted slots via a custom install hook when
  enabled with "allow-mounted=true" in the system configuration.
  This can be useful for updating bootloaders in a boot partition (for example
  on the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone). (by Martin Hundebøll and Rasmus Villemoes)
* Added the ``--mksquashfs-args`` option for bundle creation. This can be used to
  configure the details of the squashfs compression. (by Louis des Landes)
* Added the ``--casync-args`` option for the ``rauc convert`` command. This can
  be used to configure the details of the casync conversion. (by Christopher
  Obbard)
* Added support for installing UBIFS images via casync (depends on the casync PR
  https://github.com/systemd/casync/pull/227). (by Ulrich Ölmann)
* Enabled usage of ``--no-verify`` with ``rauc resign``.
  This can be useful for resigning of bundles signed with expired certificates.
* Exposed the ``RAUC_BUNDLE_MOUNT_POINT`` environment variable to hook scripts.
  This also deprecates the old name ``RAUC_UPDATE_SOURCE`` for this value in
  handler scripts. (by Rasmus Villemoes)
* Reduced size of the installed ``rauc`` binary. This was done by using
  ``--gc-sections`` and adding a configure switch to disable the ``bundle``,
  ``resign`` and ``convert`` commands. (by Rasmus Villemoes)
* Added support for explicitly telling RAUC that all slots are inactive on the
  kernel command line (``rauc.external``).
  This is useful for using RAUC in a factory installer. (by Marco Felsch)
* Improved layout of the ``rauc status`` output.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fixed SD/eMMC detection when using /dev/disk/by-path/ symlinks. (by Marco Felsch)
* Fixed handling of HTTP Content-Encoding: gzip. (by Jan Kundrát)
* Fixed reporting of errors during bundle verification. This solves a
  ``rauc-ERROR **: Not enough substeps: check_bundle`` abort. (by Rouven
  Czerwinski)
* Fixed handling of surrounding whitespace in the system variant by removing
  it. A warning is printed in this case.
* Fixed the RAUC D-Bus interface introspection file name to be consistent with
  the interface name. (by Michael Tretter)

.. rubric:: Testing

* Switched testing environment from user-mode-linux (UML) to QEMU. This allows
  us to use our own kernel configuration and avoids the (unusual) dependency.
* Re-enabled support for coverity, as they have added support for GCC 8.
* Added some more tests in several areas.

.. rubric:: Code

* Removed support for OpenSSL versions < 1.1.1.
  OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 are no longer supported by the OpenSSL
  project: https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html
* Improved support for large bundles on 32 bit systems, but some work remains
  to be done.
* Disabled automatic ``-Werror`` and ``-O0`` when building from a git
  repository.
  This caused confusion in several cases.
* Updated uncrustify and enabled some additional formatting rules.
* Reduced redundant prefixes in error messages.
* Removed unused verification functions left over from the old network mode.
* Removed minor memory leaks.

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Clarified documentation about hooks and handlers (and the available
  environment variables).
* Fixed minor typos and inconsistencies.

Release 1.2 (released Oct 27, 2019)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Added ``--signing-keyring`` argument to specify a distinct keyring for
  post-signing verification. This allows for example to use ``rauc resign``
  with certs not verifying against the original keyring.
* Output of 'rauc status' is now grouped by slot groups to make it easier to
  identify the redundancy setup.
  Previously, the present slots were printed in a random order which was
  confusing, especially when having more than three or four slots.
* Use pkg-config to obtain valid D-Bus install directories and clean up D-Bus
  directory handling.
  This adds libdbus-1-dev as new build dependency. (by Michael Heimpold)
* Moved various checks that could be performed before actually starting the
  installation out of the atomic update region.
  This allows RAUC to fail earlier without leaving behind a disabled slot group
  with incomplete contents.
* Added optional ``--progress`` argument to ``rauc install`` that enables a
  basic text progress bar instead of the default line-by-line log.
* Added ``tmppath`` to casync system config options to allow setting TMPDIR for
  casync. (by Gaël PORTAY)
* Slot skipping was deactivated by default as it turned out to be unexpected
  behaviour for many users.
  The corresponding setting was renamed to 'install-same='
  ('force-install-same' will remain valid, too).
  The means skipping writing for slots whose current and intended slot hashes
  are equal must now be enabled explicitly.
  This optimization is mainly useful for use-cases with a read-only rootfs.
* Added new slot type ``boot-mbr-switch`` to support atomic updating of boot
  partitions in the MBR. (by Thomas Hämmerle)
  See :ref:`here <sec-mbr-partition>` for details.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fixed detection of whether the bundle path is located in input directory for a
  corner case.
* Fixed off-by-one error in printing the remaining attempts counter in the
  uboot.sh contrib script (by Ellie Reeves)
* Fixed detection of mount points disappearing during the service's runtime.
* Added missing entry of 'service' subcommand to RAUC help text (if compiled
  with service support).
* Fixed inappropriate resetting of BOOT_ACK flag in eMMC extCSD register
  handling which could have prevented proper booting on some SoCs. (by Stephan
  Michaelsen)
* Fixed leaking GDataInputStreams in boot selection and install handling that
  led to steadily increasing number of open file descriptors in some scenarios
  until exceeding system limits and leading to 'Too many open files' errors.
  This was only problematic when installing many times without rebooting.
* Fixed 'uninitialized local' bugs in update_handler and config_file module.
  (by Gaël PORTAY)
* PKCS#11 handling now does not silently accept missing (empty) PINs anymore,
  but allows interactive prompt for entering it.
* Fixed bundle detection on big endian systems.
* Fixed size mismatches in printf formatter and struct packing on ARM32.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Fix checks that depended on implicit assumptions regarding the GHashTable
  behaviour that are not valid anymore for newer glib versions.
* Added notes on required tools for unit testing and added check for
  grub-editenv being present.
* Travis now also runs cross-compilation tests for platforms armhf, i386,
  arm64, armel to allow early detection of cross-compilation issues with
  endianness, 32 vs. 64 bit, etc.

.. rubric:: Code

* Reworked subprocess call logging for debugging and added remaining missing
  log output to users of r_subprocess_new().
* Refactored slot handling code in new 'slot.c' module to be used for both
  install and status information handling.
* Added qdbusxml2cpp annotations to rauc-installer.xml for interface class
  generation. (by Tobias Junghans)
* Removed the deprecated 'network mode'.
  Note that this does not affect RAUC's bundle network capabilities (casync,
  etc.).
* Fixed clang compilation warnings (unused variable, printf formatter,
  non-obvious invert statements).
* Various code cleanups, structural simplifications

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Added hints for creating ``/dev/data`` symlink to mount the right data
  partition in dual data partition setups. (by Fabian Knapp)

Release 1.0-rc1 (released Oct 12, 2018)
---------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Bundle creation

  * Add support for passing Keys/Certificates stored on PKCS#11 tokens (e.g. for using a smart card or HSM).
    See :ref:`pkcs11-support` for details.
  * Print a warning during signing if a certificate in the chain will expire within one month
  * If keyring is given during bundle creation, automatically verify bundle signature and trust chain

* Configuration
  (see the reference for the :ref:`[system] <system-section>`, :ref:`[keyring] <keyring-section>` and :ref:`[slot.*.*] <slot.slot-class.idx-section>` sections for details)

  * Add ``extra-mount-opts`` argument to slot config to allow passing custom options
    to ``mount`` calls (such as user_xattr or seclabel)
  * Implement support for ``readonly`` slots that are part of the slot description but
    should never be written by RAUC
  * Add option ``use-bundle-signing-time`` to use signing time for verification instead
    of the current time
  * Introduce ``max-bundle-download-size`` config setting (by Michael Heimpold)
  * Rename confusing ``ignore-checksum`` flag to ``force-install-same`` (old remains
    valid of course) (by Jan Remmet)
  * Add strict parsing of config files as we do for manifests already.
    This will reject configs with invalid keys, groups, etc. to prevent unintentional behavior

* Installation

  * Remove strict requirement of using ``.raucb`` file extension, although it is still recommended
  * Export RAUC slot type to handlers and hooks (by Rasmus Villemoes)
  * Add ``*.squashfs`` to ``raw`` slot handling (by Emmanuel Roullit)

  * Warn if downloaded bundle could not be deleted

* Expose system information (variant, compatible, booted slot) over D-Bus (by Jan Remmet)
* The ``rauc status`` command line call now only uses the D-Bus API (when enabled) to obtain
  status information instead of loading configuration and performing operations itself.
  This finalizes the clear separations between client and service and also allows calling
  the command line client without requiring any configuration.
* Add debug log domain ``rauc-subprocess`` for printing RAUC subprocess invocations.
  This can be activated by setting the environment variable ``G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=rauc-subprocess``.
  See :ref:`debugging` for details.
* Enhancement of many debug and error messages to be more precise and helpful
* Let U-Boot boot selection handler remove slot from ``BOOT_ORDER`` when marking it bad
* Implemented obtaining state and primary information for U-Boot boot selection interface (by Timothy Lee)

Release 0.4 (released Apr 9, 2018)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add ``barebox-statename`` key to ``[system]`` section of system.conf in order
  to allow using non-default names for barebox state
* Support atomic bootloader updates for eMMCs.
  The newly introduced slot type ``boot-emmc`` will tell RAUC to handle
  bootloader updates on eMMC by using the ``mmcblkXboot0/-boot1`` partitions
  and the EXT_CSD registers for alternating updates.
* Support writing ``*.vfat`` images to vfat slots
* Add basic support for streaming bundles using casync tool.
  Using the casync tool allows streaming bundle updates chunk-wise over
  http/https/sftp etc.
  By using the source slot as a seed for the reproducible casync chunking
  algorithm, the actual chunks to download get reduced to only those that
  differ from the original system.

  * Add ``rauc convert`` command to convert conventional bundles to casync
    bundle and chunk store
  * Extend update handler to handle ``.caibx`` and ``.caidx`` suffix image types in
    bundle
* Added ``--detailed`` argument to ``rauc status`` to obtain newly added slot
  status information
* Added D-Bus Methods ``GetSlotStatus`` to obtain collected status of all slots
* Extended information stored in slot status files (installed bundle info,
  installation and activation timestamps and counters)
* Optionally use a central status file located in a storage location not
  touched during RAUC updates instead of per-slot files (enabled by setting
  ``statusfile`` key in ``[system]`` section of ``system.conf``).
* Add ``write-slot`` command to write images directly to defined slots (for use
  during development)

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix documentation out-of-tree builds
* Fixed packaging for dbus wrapper script rauc-service.sh
* Some double-free and error handling fixes

.. rubric:: Testing
